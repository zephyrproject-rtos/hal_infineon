 * \{
 * Interface for changing power states and restricting when they are allowed.
 *
 * There are three supported MCU Power States:
 * * Active - This is the normal operating state of the MCU
 * * Sleep - In this state the MCU is no longer running. It can be woken up again
 * from an interrupt. This state is reached by calling \ref mtb_hal_syspm_sleep.
 * * Deep Sleep - In this state the MCU is no longer running. It can only be woken
 * up by select interrupts. This state is reached by calling \ref
 * mtb_hal_syspm_deepsleep.
 *
 * Some devices support multiple modes for the DeepSleep power state. The currently
 * selected DeepSleep mode, which will be entered by \ref mtb_hal_syspm_deepsleep,
 * can be determined via the \ref mtb_hal_syspm_get_deepsleep_mode function. Configuration
 * of the DeepSleep mode can be performed via platform specific APIs (e.g. PDL).
 *
 * \note The power management functionality available depends on the availability
 * of the features in the hardware. For detailed information about exactly what is
 * supported on each device, refer to the Device Datasheet or Technical Reference
 * Manual (TRM).
 *
 * Any time a power state transition is requested a series of callbacks are invoked.
 * This allows peripherals, or other parts of the application, to confirm they are
 * not currently doing something that would not work in the requested power state.
 * Middleware has the option to register a callback function(s) to be called on
 * requested state transitions by callling \ref mtb_hal_syspm_register_callback.
 * Each callback registered can specify the exact set of states
 * ( \ref mtb_hal_syspm_callback_state_t ) that it should be called for. Each callback
 * is invoked multiple times as part of the transition process as defined by
 * \ref mtb_hal_syspm_callback_mode_t.
 *
 * At any point the code can lock the ability to enter deep sleep by calling \ref
 * mtb_hal_syspm_lock_deepsleep. This should be done in critical blocks that need to
 * continue remain active. When the critical work is complete, and the lock is no
 * longer needed, it can be released by calling \ref mtb_hal_syspm_unlock_deepsleep.
 * The lock is a counter with a max count of USHRT_MAX. It must be locked/unlocked
 * an equal number of times before the device is actually able to enter deep sleep.
 *
 * \section section_syspm_features Features
 * This driver provides control over multiple different types of power management
 * and when those transitions are allowed:
 * * Change CPU Power State: APIs to allow changing the current CPU state into
 * one of the lower power CPU states (SLEEP, DEEPSLEEP)
 * * General Purpose Power State Transition Callback: APIs allow for
 * registering/unregistering a callback function to be notified when various power
 * state transitions happen. If registered, the application can do anything necessary
 * at power transitions. It can even prevent the transition if need-be.
 * - Lock DeepSleep: APIs to prevent/allow the CPU from going to deep sleep. This
 * is a convenience API rather than needing to implement a full Transition Callback
 * handler.
 *
 * \section section_syspm_quickstart Quick Start
 *
 * Unlike most HAL drivers this does not require initializing an instance object. The
 * APIs provided here can be called at anytime. See the snippets below for examples
 * of how to use this driver.
 *
 * \section section_syspm_snippets Code Snippets
 *
 * \subsection subsection_syspm_snippet_1 Snippet 1: Simple deep sleep locking
 * The following snippet shows how to use the deep sleep locking APIs to restrict
 * when the device can enter deep sleep. In between the lock/unlock calls any
 * attempt to change power modes will automatically be canceled.
 * \snippet hal_syspm.c snippet_mtb_hal_syspm_simple_locking
 *
 * \subsection subsection_syspm_snippet_2 Snippet 2: Calling different power state functions
 * The following snippet shows the different functions that exist to change power states
 * on the device and how they can each be called.
 * \snippet hal_syspm.c snippet_mtb_hal_syspm_power_transitions
 *
 * \subsection subsection_syspm_snippet_3 Snippet 3: Using callbacks for application power management
 * The following snippet shows how to use the callback mechanisms to manage whether
 * it is safe to enter low power modes.

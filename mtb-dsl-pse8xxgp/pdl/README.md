# MTB PSE8xxGP Peripheral Driver Library

### Overview
The ModusToolbox PDL simplifies software development for the PSE8xxGP family of devices.
The PDL integrates device header files, and 
peripheral drivers into a single package. The drivers abstract the hardware functions into a set of 
easy-to-use APIs. These are fully documented in the [PDL API Reference Manual](https://infineon.github.io/mtb-pdl-pse8xxgp/pdl_api_reference_manual/html/index.html). 

### Features
* Includes all the updates made to the peripheral drivers for ModusToolbox™ software
* Contains standard set of digital and analog peripheral drivers that enable rapid peripheral software development in third-party IDEs
* The ARM Cortex® Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS) core access header files
* CMSIS compliant device header files, startup code (platform initialization) and device configuration header files

The PDL reduces the need to understand register usage and bit structures, 
thus easing software development for the extensive set of peripherals in the 
PSE8xxGP series. 
See the [PDL API Reference Manual](https://infineon.github.io/mtb-device-support-pse8xxgp/pdl_api_reference_manual/html/index.html) for more detailed information.
See the [PDL Release Notes](./RELEASE.md) for release-specific information.

### Peripheral Drivers
The PDL provides a high-level API to configure, initialize, and use a peripheral driver. 
The drivers are designed for peripheral IP blocks. 
See [PDL API Reference](https://infineon.github.io/mtb-device-support-pse8xxgp/pdl_api_reference_manual/html/modules.html) for the list of drivers.

### Quick Start
See the [PDL API Reference Manual Getting Started section](https://infineon.github.io/mtb-device-support-pse8xxgp/pdl_api_reference_manual/html/page_getting_started.html) for quick start instructions.

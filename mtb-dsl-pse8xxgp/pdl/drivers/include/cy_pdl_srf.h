/**
* \addtogroup group_pdl_srf
* \{
* This file contains the cy_pdl_srf_module_register API.  This must be called on
* the secure side during startup after Secure Request Framework (SRF) initialization
* in order to call Secure Aware PDL APIs.
*
* \section group_pdl_srf_general Secure Aware PDL
* Some APIs are marked as Secure Aware.  This means that if the driver's hardware resource
* is marked as a secure resource in the Peripheral Protection Controller (PPC) and these APIs
* are called from a non-secure CPU state, the PDL will submit a request to the Secure Request
* Framework (SRF) middleware to transition to a secure CPU state to perform the operation.
* From the application's perspective, the API will behave the same whether it is called from
* a secure or non-secure CPU state albeit slower.
*
* Note that the inverse is not supported - calling to an API that operates on a non-secured
* resource from a secure CPU state will not be automatically handled and will result in a PPC
* fault. To perform this action legally, abide by ARM guidelines for calling to NS from S.
*
* The general rule is
* 1. Secure-aware APIs:
*      Some of these APIs involve multiple PPC regions. See the documentation for individual APIs
*      for restrictions on how these PPC regions must be configured relative to each other.
*      Custom PPC configurations which do not meet the requirements of a security API may be handled as follows:
*      1. Access to secure resources from a non-secure processing environment can be enabled
*         by creating a custom secure operation. See the secure request framework documentation for details.
*      2. Access to a non-secure resource from a secure processing environment may be achieved either
*         by following ARM's "guidelines for calling to NS from S" or by using the `GET_NSALIAS_ADDRESS` macro.
* 2. Non Secure-aware APIs:
*      All involved PPC regions should be either secure (calling to the API in secure CPU state) or
*      non-secure (calling to the API in non-secure CPU state).
*
* This functionality is automatically enabled on devices with ARM TrustZone processors. To
* disable all driver Secure Awareness, set the DEFINE+=CY_PDL_ENABLE_SECURE_AWARE=0 in the
* application Makefile.  To disable specific drivers, each has a matching macro that can be
* used in the same way, e.g. RTC has CY_PDL_ENABLE_SECURE_AWARE_RTC.  See individual driver
* documentation for specific macro names.
*
* Marking a hardware resource as Non-Secure via the PPC in the device configurator will also
* disable the Secure Aware driver to save memory during secure image compilation.  For drivers
* with multiple hardware resource instances (e.g. SCBs), the Secure Aware APIs will take the
* default or SRF route depending on if the instance they're invoked on is Secured.  If all
* resources are marked Non-Secure, the Secure Aware driver will be disabled.
*
* Secure Awareness is only relevent on APIs which interact with hardware resources. APIs which
* do not interact with hardware resources have notes in the API's function header comments
* documenting that they are safe to call from either state.
*
* \section group_pdl_srf_setup Setup
* The Secure Aware PDL that requires a shared request pool (see SRF documentation) is setup for
* it to allocate requests from.  This pool is initialized by default as part of cybsp_init on the
* Non-Secure CPU.
*
* The \ref cy_pdl_srf_module_register API must be called with the default cybsp_secure_context
* secure context to register the secure operations for SRF to reference.  This is similarly done
* as part of cybsp_init, but on the Secure CPU.

* \section group_smif_section_secure_aware Secure Aware RTC
* Some RTC APIs are marked as Secure Aware.  This means that if the RTC is marked
* as a secure resource in the Peripheral Protection Controller (PPC) and these
* APIs are called from a non-secure CPU state, the PDL will submit a request to the
* Secure Request Framework (SRF) middleware to transition to a secure CPU state to
* perform the operation.  From the application's perspective, the API will behave
* the same whether it is called from a secure or non-secure CPU state albeit slower.
*
* This functionality is automatically enabled on devices with ARM TrustZone processors.
* To disable, set the DEFINE+=CY_PDL_ENABLE_SECURE_AWARE_RTC=0 in the application
* Makefile.
*
* For more information on Secure Aware PDL behavior, see \ref group_pdl_srf_general.

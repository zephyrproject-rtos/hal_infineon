# MTB CAT1 Peripheral Driver Library v3.12.1

Please refer to the [README.md](./README.md) and the
[PDL API Reference Manual](https://infineon.github.io/mtb-pdl-cat1/pdl_api_reference_manual/html/index.html)
for a complete description of the Peripheral Driver Library.


## Implementation Details
* CAT1A: Support for EZ-USB FX3G2 devices: cyusb4xxx, cyusb3xxx, cyusb2xxx


## Build Changes

## Personality Changes

## Added Drivers

## Updated Drivers

### Drivers with patch version updates

### Obsoleted part numbers

## Known Issues
* CAT1A: In device-configurator, certain IP is not completely available for some devices as some combinations of pin connections are not valid.
  * CYT2BL4BAS/CYT2BL4CAE: SCB6 is complete only for UART, cannot support I2C, EZI2C, or SPI.
  * CYT2BL3CAE, CYT2B7CAE: SCB1 is complete only for UART, cannot support I2C, EZI2C, or SPI.
  * On the following devices: CAN FD 0 Channel 3, CAN FD 1 Channel 1, CAN FD 1 Channel 3 is not available (no signal for CAN Rx Pin available).
    * CYT2BL4BAS, CYT2BL3CAE, CYT2BL3CAS, CYT2BL4CAE, CYT2BL3BAE, CYT2BL4BAE, CYT2BL4CAS, CYT2BL3BAS, CYT2B73BAS, CYT2B73CAS, CYT2B73BAE
* Traveo II B-E: Does not support emulated eeprom.
* CAT1A: On soft reset, user need to reset back up domain using Cy_SysLib_ResetBackupDomain() to receive Cy_RTC_CenturyInterrupt() callback on Century roll over.
* On building with tools 2.2, user get warning related to the older version of tools used. To avoid this warning, user is advised to migrate to newer tools version or keep working with previous version of this library.  The warning generated is as follows:
  * _#warning "(Library) The referenced 'device support library' contains newer content than is supported. Either downgrade the version of the 'device support library' referenced or upgrade the version of tools being used_
* Design configuration will not be auto migrated from smartio-3.0.cypersonality to smartio-4.0.cypersonality. So, existing projects should use smartio-3.0.cypersonality. New projects can make use of smartio-4.0.cypersonality which includes additional improvements.


## Defect Fixes

* Drivers:
  * See the Changelog section of each Driver in the [PDL API Reference](https://infineon.github.io/mtb-pdl-cat1/pdl_api_reference_manual/html/modules.html) for all fixes and updates.
* Other:
  * system_cm7.c - Fixing assignment of the cy_Hfclk0FreqHz global variable.

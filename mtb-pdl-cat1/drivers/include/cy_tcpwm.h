/**
* \addtogroup group_tcpwm
* \{
*
* The TCPWM driver is a multifunction driver that implements Timer Counter,
* PWM, Quadrature Decoder, Shift Register and Motion Interface functionality using the TCPWM block.
*
* The functions and other declarations used in this driver are in cy_tcpwm_counter.h,
* cy_tcpwm_pwm.h, cy_tcpwm_quaddec.h, cy_tcpwm_shiftreg.h, cy_tcpwm_motif.h respectively. Include cy_pdl.h
* to get access to all functions and declarations in the PDL.
*
* Each TCPWM block is a collection of counters that can all be triggered
* simultaneously. For each function call, the base register address of
* the TCPWM being used must be passed first, followed by the index of
* the counter you want to touch next.
*
* The TCPWM supports eight function modes:
* * Timer
* * Capture
* * Quadrature Decoder
* * Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)
* * PWM with dead time insertion (PWMDT)
* * Pseudo random PWM (PWMPR)
* * Shift Register
* * Motion Interface (MOTIF)
*
* The TCPWM driver is structured to map these seven functional modes to four
* high level operating modes:
* * Timer/Counter (includes Timer, Capture modes)
* * PWM (PWM, PWMDT, PWMPR)
* * Quadrature Decoder
* * Shift Register
* * MOTIF
*
* A brief description on each of the operating modes:
*
* \b Timer/Counter
*
* Use this mode whenever a specific timing interval or measurement is
* needed. Examples include:
* * Creating a periodic interrupt for running other system tasks
* * Measuring frequency of an input signal
* * Measuring pulse width of an input signal
* * Measuring time between two external events
* * Counting events
* * Triggering other system resources after x number events
* * Capturing time stamps when events occur
*
* \n
* \b PWM
*
* Use this mode when an output square wave is needed with a specific
* period and duty cycle, such as:
* * Creating arbitrary square wave outputs
* * Driving an LED (changing the brightness)
* * Driving Motors (dead time assertion available)
*
* \n
* \b Quadrature \b Decoder
*
* A quadrature decoder is used to decode the output of a quadrature encoder.
* A quadrature encoder senses the position, velocity, and direction of
* an object (for example a rotating axle, or a spinning mouse ball).
* A quadrature decoder can also be used for precision measurement of speed,
* acceleration, and position of a motor's rotor, or with a rotary switch to
* determine user input. \n
*
* \n
* \b Shift \b Register
*
* Shift Register functionality shifts the counter value to the right.
* A shift register is used to apply a signal delay function which can be used
* eg: in detecting frequency shift keying (FSK) signals.
* A shift register is also used in parallel-in to serial-out data conversion
* and serial-in to parallel-out data conversion.
*
* \section group_tcpwm_version_information TCPWM Versions
*
* There are three versions of TCPWM driver
*
* \b TCPWM \b Version \b 3
*
* - The mxtcpwm.3.0 consists of up to 2048, 16-bit or 32-bit counters
* - Counter groups up to 8*256
* - Counter compare, period, line_sel and dead time registers are double buffered.
* - Parallel data path support for CC0/CC1 register through dedicated data interface (only applicable to mxtcpwm 3.1, PSOC C3 do not support this)
* - Glitch Filter with configurable depth supported on General-purpose triggers used by all counters and specific one-to-one triggers for each counter
* - Shadow registers available for duty, period, dead time, signal and polarity
* - Enhanced shadow update mechanism
* - Independent control of clock pre-scalar and dead time
* - Configurable PWM dithering on period as well as duty cycle
* - Configurable option to continue / pause with the ability to enter passive state through kill polarity in debug mode
* - Output state control for PWM signal during stop or kill operation synchronous to period match
* - Independent line polarity setting for PWM signal during kill operation
* - Support up to 4 Motion Interface (MOTIF)
*     - Support interrupt output for each MOTIF
*     - Hall interface for direct connection to Hall sensors
*     - HW look-up table for advance motor control feedback loop operation
*     - Synchronous modulation support for multiple counters
* - Support HRPWM (High resolution PWM generation) feature in both 16-bit and 32-bit TCPWM counters (Only applicable to mxtcpwm 3.1, PSOC C3 only has 4 HRPWM blocks on the 32 bit PWMs.)
*     - HRPWM enhancements are limited to PWM and PWM_DT mode only
*     - HRPWM consists of an analog interpolator (also referred as delay element)
*     - Analog interpolator consists of delay elements which uses the input clock to generate a set of delayed phases. These delayed phases are then used to delay the edges of the incoming PWM from tcpwm.
*     - Analog interpolator is used to shift the edges of line_out and line_compl_out coming as output from the TCPWM to the analog interpolator.
*     - The LSBs are used for fractional or micro ticks for delaying the line_out and line_compl_out outputs for  PERIOD/PERIOD_BUFF, CC0/CC0_BUFF, and CC1/CC1_BUFF and DT/DT_BUFF.
*     - Number of LSB bits used for fractional control is control by the design time parameter, GRP_HRPWM_WIDTH.
*     - The remaining bits given by [GRP_CNT_WIDTH-1:GRP_HRPWM_WIDTH] are used by the mxtcpwm counter.
*

*
* - \b Input \b Trigger \b Selection \b and \b Event \b Detection

* - Devices CY8C61x6, CY8C61x7, CY8C62x5, CY8C62x6, CY8C62x7, CY8C62x8, CY8C62xA, CY8C63x6, CY8C63x7, CYS0644xxZI-S2D44,
* CYB0644xxZI-S4D44, CYB06447BZI-BLDX, CYB06447BZI-D54 and CYB06445LQI-S3D42 use this version.
* - Supports up to 32 counters (check TRM for actual number of counters supported)

* - Support one interrupt output for each counter.
*
* \image html tcpwm_v1_block_diagram.png
*
* - Many functions work with an individual counter. You can also manage multiple counters simultaneously for certain functions.
* - These are listed in the \ref group_tcpwm_functions_common section of the TCPWM.
* - You can enable, disable, or trigger (in various ways) multiple counters simultaneously.
* - For these functions you provide a bit field representing each counter in the TCPWM you want to control.
* - You can represent the bit field as an ORed mask of each counter, like ((1U << cntNumX) | (1U << cntNumX) | (1U << cntNumX)), where X is the counter number from 0 to 31.
*
* \note
* * If none of the input terminals (start, reload(index)) are used, the
* software event \ref Cy_TCPWM_TriggerStart or
* \ref Cy_TCPWM_TriggerReloadOrIndex must be called to start the counting.
* * If count input terminal is not used, the \ref CY_TCPWM_INPUT_LEVEL macro
* should be set for the countInputMode parameter and the \ref CY_TCPWM_INPUT_1
* macro should be set for the countInput parameter in the configuration
* structure of the appropriate mode(Counter
* \ref group_tcpwm_data_structures_counter, PWM
* \ref group_tcpwm_data_structures_pwm, QuadDec
* \ref group_tcpwm_data_structures_quaddec, or Shift Register
* \ref group_tcpwm_data_structures_shiftreg).

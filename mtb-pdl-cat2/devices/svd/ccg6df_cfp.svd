              <name>ENABLE</name>
              <description>Clock divider enable command (mutually exclusive with DISABLE). Typically, SW sets this field to '1' to enable a divider and HW sets this field to '0' to indicate that divider enabling has completed. When a divider is enabled, its integer and fractional (if present) counters are initialized to '0'. If a divider is to be re-enabled using different integer and fractional divider values, the SW should follow these steps:
0: Disable the divider using the DIV_CMD.DISABLE field.
1: Configure the divider's DIV_XXX_CTL register.
2: Enable the divider using the DIV_CMD_ENABLE field.
 
The SEL_DIV and SEL_TYPE fields specify which divider is to be enabled. The enabled divider may be phase aligned to either 'clk_hf' (typical usage) or to ANY enabled divider.
 
The PA_SEL_DIV and P_SEL_TYPE fields specify the reference divider.
 
The HW sets the ENABLE field to '0' when the enabling is performed and the HW sets the DIV_XXX_CTL.EN field of the divider to '1' when the enabling is performed. Note that enabling with phase alignment to a low frequency divider takes time. E.g. To align to a divider that generates a clock of 'clk_hf'/n (with n being the integer divider value INT_DIV+1), up to n cycles may be required to perform alignment. Phase alignment to 'clk_hf' takes affect immediately. SW can set this field to '0' during phase alignment to abort the enabling process.</description>

If SEL_DIV is '63' and 'SEL_TYPE' is '3' (default/reset value), no divider is specified and no clock control signal(s) are generated.
 
When transitioning a clock between two out of phase dividers, spurious clock control signals may be generated for one 'clk_hf' cycle during this transition. These clock control signals may cause a single clock period that is smaller than any of the two divider periods. To prevent these spurious clock signals, the clock multiplexer can be disconnected (SEL_DIV is '63' and 'SEL_TYPE' is '3') for a transition time that is larger than the smaller of the two divider periods.</description>

                <description>Specifies input trigger. This field is typically set during the setup of a chip use case scenario. Changing this field while activated triggers are present on the input triggers may result in unpredictable behavior. Note that input trigger 0 (default value) is typically connected to a constant signal level of '0', and as a result will not cause HW activation of the output trigger.</description>

              <description>Always write 0 except as noted below. 

For PSoC 4000 CapSense products, set this bit if Vccd is provided externally (on Vccd pin).  Setting this bit turns off the active regulator and will lead to system reset (BOD) unless both Vddd and Vccd pins are supplied externally.  This register bit only resets for XRES, POR, or a detected BOD.</description>

              <description>Delay to wait for references to settle on wakeup from deepsleep.  BOD is ignored and system does not resume until this delay expires. Note that the same delay on POR is hard-coded.  The default assumes the output of the predivider is 48MHz + 3 percent.  Firmware may scale this setting according to the fastest actual clock frequency that can occur when waking from DEEPSLEEP.</description>

              <description>Regulator over-temp interrupt.  This interrupt can occur when a short circuit exists on the vccd pin or when extreme loads are applied on IO-cells causing the die to overheat.  Firmware is encourage to shutdown all IO cells and then go to DeepSleep mode when this interrupt occurs if protection against such conditions is desired.</description>

              <description>Each IO port has an associated bit field in this register. The bit field reflects the IO port's interrupt line (bit field i reflects 'interrupts_gpio[i]' for IO port i). The register is used when the system uses a shared/combined interrupt line 'interrupt_gpio'. The SW ISR reads the register to determine which IO port(s) is responsible for the shared/combined interrupt line 'interrupt_gpio'. Once, the IO port(s) is determined, the IO port's INTR register is read to determine the IO pad(s) in the IO port that caused the interrupt.</description>

'0': Internally clocked mode 
'1': Externally clocked mode 

In internally clocked mode, the serial interface protocols run off the SCB clock. In externally clocked mode, the serial interface protocols run off the clock as provided by the serial interface.

The clocking for the rest of the logic is determined by CTRL.EC_OP_MODE.

Externally clocked mode is only used for synchronous serial interface protocols (SPI and I2C) in slave mode. In SPI mode, only Motorola submode (all Motorola modes: 0, 1, 2, 3) is supported.

In UART mode this field should be '0'.</description>

'0': Internally clocked mode 
'1': externally clocked mode
 In internally clocked mode, the serial interface protocols run off the SCB clock. In externally clocked mode, the serial interface protocols run off the clock as provided by the serial interface. 

Externally clocked operation mode is only used for synchronous serial interface protocols (SPI and I2C) in slave mode AND EZ mode. In SPI mode, only Motorola submode (all Motorola modes: 0, 1, 2, 3) is supported. The maximum SPI slave, EZ mode bitrate is 48 Mbps (transmission and IO delays outside the IP will degrade the effective bitrate).

In UART mode this field should be '0'.</description>

              <description>Non EZ mode ('0') or EZ mode ('1').
In EZ mode, a meta protocol is applied to the serial interface protocol. This meta protocol adds meaning to the data frames transferred by the serial interface protocol: a data frame can represent a memory address, a write memory data element or a read memory data element. EZ mode is only used for synchronous serial interface protocols: SPI and I2C. In SPI mode, only Motorola submode (all Motorola modes: 0, 1, 2, 3) is supported and the transmitter should use continuous data frames; i.e. data frames not separated by slave deselection. This mode is only applicable to slave functionality. In EZ mode, the slave can read from and write to an addressable memory structure of 32 bytes. In EZ mode, data frames should 8-bit in size and should be transmitted and received with the Most Significant Bit (MSB) first.

In UART mode this field should be '0'.</description>

In I2C mode, this field is used to allow the slave to put the received slave address or general call address in the RX FIFO. Note that a received matching address is put in the RX FIFO when this bit is '1' for both I2C read and write transfers.

In multi-processor UART receiver mode, this field is used to allow the receiver to put the received address in the RX FIFO. Note: non-matching addresses are never put in the RX FIFO.</description>

Colliding accesses are registered as interrupt causes: INTR_TX.BLOCKED and INTR_RX.BLOCKED.</description>

              <description>SCB block is enabled ('1') or not ('0'). The proper order in which to initialize SCB is as follows:
- Program protocol specific information using SPI_CTRL, UART_CTRL (and UART_TX_CTRL and UART_RX_CTRL) or I2C_CTRL registers. This includes selection of a submode, master/slave functionality and transmitter/receiver functionality when applicable.
- Program generic transmitter (TX_CTRL) and receiver (RX_CTRL) information. This includes enabling of the transmitter and receiver functionality.
- Program transmitter FIFO (TX_FIFO_CTRL) and receiver FIFO (RX_FIFO_CTRL) information.
- Program CTRL register to enable SCB, select the specific operation mode and oversampling factor.
When this block is enabled, no control information should be changed. Changes should be made AFTER disabling this block, e.g. to modify the operation mode (from I2C to SPI) or to go from externally to internally clocked. The change takes effect after the block is re-enabled. Note that disabling the block will cause re-initialization of the design and associated state is lost (e.g. FIFO content).</description>

              <description>Only applicable in standard UART submode. When '1', the receiver performs break detection and baud rate detection on the incoming data. First, break detection counts the amount of bit periods that have a line value of '0'. BREAK_WIDTH specifies the minimum required amount of bit periods. Successful break detection sets the INTR_RX.BREAK_DETECT interrupt cause to '1'. Second, baud rate detection counts the amount of peripheral clock periods that are use to receive the synchronization byte (0x55; least significant bit first). The count is available through UART_RX_STATUS.BR_COUNTER. Successful baud rate detection sets the INTR_RX.BAUD_DETECT interrupt cause to '1' (BR_COUNTER is reliable). This functionality is used to synchronize/refine the receiver clock to the transmitter clock. The receiver software can use the BR_COUNTER value to set the right IP clock (from the programmable clock IP) to guarantee successful receipt of the first LIN data frame (Protected Identifier Field) after the synchronization byte.</description>

              <description>This field is used during an address match or general call address in internally clocked mode 
Only used when:
 - EC_AM_MODE is '0', EC_OP_MODE is '0', S_GENERAL_IGNORE is '0] and non EZ mode.
Functionality is as follows:
- 1: a received (matching) slave address is immediately NACK'd when the receiver FIFO is full.
- 0: clock stretching is performed (till the receiver FIFO is no longer full). 

For externally clocked logic (EC_AM is '1') on an address match or general call address (and S_GENERAL_IGNORE is '0'). Only used when (NOT used when EC_AM is '1' and EC_OP is '1' and address match and EZ mode):
- EC_AM is '1' and EC_OP is '0'.
- EC_AM is '1' and general call address match.
- EC_AM is '1' and non EZ mode.
Functionality is as follows:
- 1: a received (matching or general) slave address is always immediately NACK'd. There are two possibilities:
       1). the SCB clock is available (in Active system power mode) and it handles the rest of the current transfer. In this case the I2C master will not observe the NACK. 
       2).SCB clock is not present (in DeepSleep system power mode). In this case the I2C master will observe the NACK and may retry the transfer in the future (which gives the internally clocked logic the time to wake up from DeepSleep system power mode). 
- 0: clock stretching is performed (till the SCB clock is available). The logic will handle the ongoing transfer as soon as the clock is enabled.</description>

When '1', loopback is enabled internally in the peripheral, and as a result unaffected by other I2C devices. This allows a SCB I2C peripheral to address itself.</description>

              <description>I2C bus is busy. The bus is considered busy ('1'), from the time a START is detected or from the time the SCL line is '0'. The bus is considered idle ('0'), from the time a STOP is detected. If SCB block is disabled, BUS_BUSY is '0'. After enabling the block, it takes time for the BUS_BUSY to detect a busy bus. This time is the maximum high time of the SCL line. For a 100 kHz interface frequency, this maximum high time may last roughly 5 us (half a bit period).

For single master systems, BUS_BUSY does not have to be used to detect an idle bus before a master starts a transfer using I2C_M_CMD.M_START (no bus collisions).

For multi-master systems, BUS_BUSY can be used to detect an idle bus before a master starts a transfer using I2C_M_CMD.M_START_ON_IDLE (to prevent bus collisions).</description>

              <description>When '1', transmit a START or REPEATED START. Whether a START or REPEATED START is transmitted depends on the state of the master state machine. A START is only transmitted when the master state machine is in the default state. A REPEATED START is transmitted when the master state machine is not in the default state, but is working on an ongoing transaction. The REPEATED START can only be transmitted after a NACK or ACK has been received for a transmitted data element or after a NACK has been transmitted for a received data element. When this action is performed, the hardware sets this field to '0'.</description>

              <description>When '1', transmit a START as soon as the bus is idle (I2C_STATUS.BUS_BUSY is '0', note that BUSY has a default value of '0'). For bus idle detection the hardware relies on STOP detection. As a result, bus idle detection is only functional after at least one I2C bus transfer has been detected on the bus (default/reset value of BUSY is '0') . A START is only transmitted when the master state machine is in the default state. When this action is performed, the hardware sets this field to '0'.</description>

This should not occur, it represents erroneous I2C bus behavior. In case of lost arbitration, the I2C slave state machine aborts the ongoing transfer. The Firmware may decide to clear the TX and RX FIFOs in case of this error.</description>

'0': counter disabled.
'1': counter enabled.
Counter static configuration information (e.g. CTRL.MODE, all TR_CTRL0, TR_CTRL1, and TR_CTRL2 register fields) should only be modified when the counter is disabled. When a counter is disabled, command and status information associated to the counter is cleared by HW, this includes:
- the associated counter triggers in the CMD register are set to '0'.
- the counter's interrupt cause fields in counter's INTR register.
- the counter's status fields in counter's STATUS register..
- the counter's trigger outputs ('tr_overflow', 'tr_underflow' and 'tr_compare_match').
- the counter's line outputs ('line_out' and 'line_compl_out').</description>

In these modes, the kill trigger is used to either temporarily block the PWM outputs (PWM_STOP_ON_KILL is '0') or stop the functionality (PWM_STOP_ON_KILL is '1'). For the PWM and PWM_DT modes, the blocking of the output signals can be  asynchronous (STOP_EDGE should be NO_EDGE_DET) in which case the blocking is as long as the trigger is '1' or synchronous (STOP_EDGE should be RISING_EDGE) in which case it extends till the next terminal count event.</description>

              <description>ECC checking enable:
'0': Disabled. No ECC checking, no fault reporting.
'1': Enabled.

ECC checking is performed for the AHB-Lite master interface incoming read data and for the AHB-Lite slave interface incoming write data (for MMIO writes). 

For the AHB-Lite master interface, error correction is NOT performed (even NOT for theoratically correctable ECC errors). Therefore, an ECC error is always non-correctable. ECC errors do not generate a bus error. This decision is made as error corection and bus error generation would end up in a critical timing path.

For the AHB-Lite slave interface, error correction is performed for correctable ECC errors. An ECC error is either correctable or non-correctable.

Two fault signal interfaces are supported for correctable and non-correctable ECC errors.</description>

              <description>Specifies an initialization delay: number of removed/dropped samples before reduced bits are generated. This field should be programmed in the range [1, 255]. After starting the oscillators, at least the first 2 samples should be removed/dropped to clear the state of internal synchronizers. In addition, it is advised to drop at least the second 2 samples from the oscillators (to circumvent the semi-predictable oscillator startup behavior). This result in the default field value of '3'. Field encoding is as follows:
'0': 1 sample is dropped.
'1': 2 samples are dropped.
...
'255': 256 samples are dropped.

The INTR.INITIALIZED interrupt cause is set to '1', when the initialization delay is passed.</description>

'0': disabled.
'1': enabled.
The 'von Neumann corrector' post-processes the reduced bits to remove a '0' or '1' bias. The corrector operates on reduced bit pairs ('oldest bit, newest bit'):
'00': no bit is produced.
'01': '0' bit is produced (oldest bit).
'10': '1' bit is produced (oldest bit).
'11': no bit is produced.
Note that the corrector produces bits at a random pace and at a frequency that is 1/4 of the reduced bit frequency (reduced bits are processed in pairs, and half of the pairs do NOT produce a bit).</description>

Any number larger than the size of the flash indicates that the entire flash is user mode accessible. Note that Supervisory rows are always User accessible.

If FLASH_PROT_LIMIT defines a non-empty privileged area, the boot ROM will assume that a system call table exists at the beginning of the Flash privileged area and use it for all SystemCalls made using SYSREQ.</description>

              <description>0': IP is disabled. Non-retainable MMIO registers and logic functionality are reset (retainable MMIO registers are NOT reset):
- INTR register is set to '0'.
- DW/DMA functionality is aborted.
- DW/DMA controller input/pending triggers are de-activated.
- DW/DMA controller output triggers are de-activated.
Disabling the IP has the same effect as an active 'rst_sys_act_n' reset in DeepSleep power mode. To prevent a loss of active (pending) DW/DMA triggers when disabling the IP or when transitioning from Active to DeepSleep power mode, the STATUS.ACTIVE and STATUS_CH_ACT.CH fields can be used.

Note that most MMIO registers are retainable, and a transition from DeepSleep to Active/Sleep power modes makes the DW/DMA controller operational, and ready to react to DW/DMA input triggers that are activated after the transition. Triggers are Active/Sleep functionality.
'1': IP is enabled.</description>

This field is used to synchronize the controller's data transfer(s) with the agent that generated the trigger. This field is ONLY used at the completion of an opcode. E.g., a FIFO indicates that it is empty and it needs a new data sample. The agent removes the trigger ONLY when the data sample has been written by the transfer engine AND received by the agent.  Furthermore, the agent's trigger may be delayed by a few cycles before it reaches the DW/DMA controller. This field is used for level sensitive trigger, which reflect state (pulse sensitive triggers should have this field set to '0'). The wait cycles incurred by this field reduce DW/DMA controller performance.
'0': Do not wait for de-activation (for pulse sensitive triggers).
'1': Wait for up to 4 cycles.
'2': Wait for up to 8 cycles.
'3': Wait indefinitely. This option may result in DW/DMA controller lockup if the system trigger is not de-activated by the source agent.</description>

This field allows higher priority activated channels to preempt the current transfer in between these atomic (load, store) sequences. Preemption will NOT deactivate the current channel. As a result, after completion of a higher priority activated channel, the current channel is rescheduled.</description>

                <name>OPCODE</name>
                <description>Specifies the specific data transfer (only when the VALID bit of the descriptor's STATUS word is '1'):

'0': A single trigger initiates a single data element transfer (DW mode). This opcode specifies a transfer of a single data element. The current descriptor is completed when the amount of transferred single data elements equals the programmed buffer size (DATA_NR+1).

'1': A single trigger initiates a single descriptor transfer (DMA mode). This opcode specifies a transfer of DATA_NR+1 data elements as specified by the current descriptor structure. The current descriptor is completed when its data transfer is completed.

'2': A single trigger initiates a descriptor list transfer (DMA mode). This opcode specifies a transfer of DATA_NR+1 data elements as specified by the current descriptor structure and by successive valid descriptors. The current descriptor is completed when its data transfer is completed. This OPCODE relies on FLIPPING to be set to '1', such that the CH_CTLi.PING_PONG field is flipped/inverted and the successive descriptor is used. This continues for as long as the successive descriptor is valid. Note that as the HW is using the PING/PONG descriptor, the SW can prepare the alternate PONG/PING descriptor. The interrupt mechanism is used by HW to convey to the SW that the current descriptor is completed (and can be prepared for a successive transfer).

After completion of the opcode (and waiting for de-activation, the channel's output trigger is activated).</description>

                <description>Specifies the index of the current data transfer. This value increases from 0 to CONTROL.DATA_NR. HW sets this field:
- When a descriptor is done (RESPONSE is DONE), the field is set to '0' when PING_CTL.INV_DESCR is '0' and the field is set to PING_CTL.DATA_NR when PING_CTL.INV_DESCR is '1'.
- When a descriptor is not done (RESPONSE is NO_ERROR), the field reflects the progress of a data transfer.
- In case of erroneous behavior (RESPONSE is neither DONE or NO_ERROR), the field is not updated, but keeps its value to ease debugging.
HW only modifies this field for an active descriptor (STATUS.VALID to be '1'). At descriptor initialization, SW should set this field to '0'. 

This field allows software to read the progress of the data transfer. Note that SRC.ADDR and DST.ADDR represent base addresses and are not modified during data transfer. However, STATUS.CURR_DATA_NR is modified during data transfer and provides an offset wrt. the base addresses.</description>

                <description>Response code (the first two codes NO_ERROR and DONE are the result of normal behavior, the other codes are the result of erroneous behavior).
'0'/NO_ERROR: No error. Setting this response does NOT set the interrupt cause bit to '1'. STATUS.VALID is NOT affected. CH_CTLi.ENABLED is NOT affected. CH_CTLi.PING_PONG is not updated. This response is used for an unused or not completed descriptor. Software should set the RESPONSE field to '0'/NO_ERROR during descriptor initialization.
'1'/DONE: Descriptor is done (without errors). Setting this response sets the interrupt cause bit to '1' if CONTROL.SET_CAUSE is '1'. STATUS.VALID is set to '0' if CONTROL.INV_DESCR is '1'. CH_CTLi.ENABLED is NOT affected. CH_CTLi.PING_PONG is updated if CONTROL.FLIPPING is '1'.
'2'/SRC_BUS_ERROR: Bus error while loading data from the source location. Setting this response sets the interrupt cause bit to '1'. STATUS.VALID is set '0'. CH_CTLi.ENABLED is set to '0'. CH_CTLi.PING_PONG is not updated (it identifies the descriptor that caused the error).
'3'/DST_BUS_ERROR: Bus error while storing data to the destination location. Setting this response sets the interrupt cause bit to '1'. STATUS.VALID is set '0'. CH_CTLi.ENABLED is set to '0'. CH_CTLi.PING_PONG is not updated (it identifies the descriptor that caused the error).
'4'/SRC_MISAL: Misalignment of source address. This occurs on a 16-bit bus transfer that is not 2-byte aligned or on a 32-bit bus transfer that is not 4-byte aligned. Setting this response sets the interrupt cause bit to '1'. STATUS.VALID is set '0'. CH_CTLi.ENABLED is set to '0'. CH_CTLi.PING_PONG is not updated (it identifies the descriptor that caused the error).
'5'/DST_MISAL: Misalignment of destination address. This occurs on a 16-bit bus transfer that is not 2-byte aligned or on a 32-bit bus transfer that is not 4-byte aligned. Setting this response sets the interrupt cause bit to '1'. STATUS.VALID is set '0'. CH_CTLi.ENABLED is set to '0'. CH_CTLi.PING_PONG is not updated (it identifies the descriptor that caused the error).
'6'/INVALID_DESCR: Invalid descriptor (STATUS.VALID is '0'). This occurs when an activated channel has an invalid descriptor. CH_CTLi.ENABLED is set to '0'. CH_CTLi.PING_PONG is not updated (it identifies the descriptor that caused the error).</description>

Hardware set this field to '0' when a descriptor is done, but only if CONTROL.INV_DESCR is '1'.

Software sets this field to '1' when a descriptor is initialized.</description>

The page size is used to determine the number of Bytes in a page for Flash page based operations (e.g. PGM_PAGE).

Note: the field name FLASH_ROW is misleading, as this field specifies the number of Bytes in a page, rather than the number of Bytes in a row. In a single plane flash macro architecture, a page consists of a single row. However, in a multi plane flash macro architecture, a page consists of multiple rows from different planes.</description>

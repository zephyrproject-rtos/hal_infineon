              <name>ENABLE</name>
              <description>Clock divider enable command (mutually exclusive with DISABLE). Typically, SW sets this field to '1' to enable a divider and HW sets this field to '0' to indicate that divider enabling has completed. When a divider is enabled, its integer and fractional (if present) counters are initialized to '0'. If a divider is to be re-enabled using different integer and fractional divider values, the SW should follow these steps:
0: Disable the divider using the DIV_CMD.DISABLE field.
1: Configure the divider's DIV_XXX_CTL register.
2: Enable the divider using the DIV_CMD_ENABLE field.
 
The SEL_DIV and SEL_TYPE fields specify which divider is to be enabled. The enabled divider may be phase aligned to either 'clk_hf' (typical usage) or to ANY enabled divider.
 
The PA_SEL_DIV and P_SEL_TYPE fields specify the reference divider.
 
The HW sets the ENABLE field to '0' when the enabling is performed and the HW sets the DIV_XXX_CTL.EN field of the divider to '1' when the enabling is performed. Note that enabling with phase alignment to a low frequency divider takes time. E.g. To align to a divider that generates a clock of 'clk_hf'/n (with n being the integer divider value INT_DIV+1), up to n cycles may be required to perform alignment. Phase alignment to 'clk_hf' takes affect immediately. SW can set this field to '0' during phase alignment to abort the enabling process.</description>

If SEL_DIV is '63' and 'SEL_TYPE' is '3' (default/reset value), no divider is specified and no clock control signal(s) are generated.
 
When transitioning a clock between two out of phase dividers, spurious clock control signals may be generated for one 'clk_hf' cycle during this transition. These clock control signals may cause a single clock period that is smaller than any of the two divider periods. To prevent these spurious clock signals, the clock multiplexer can be disconnected (SEL_DIV is '63' and 'SEL_TYPE' is '3') for a transition time that is larger than the smaller of the two divider periods.</description>

              <description>Delay to wait for references to settle on wakeup from DeepSleep.  BOD is ignored and system does not resume until this delay expires. Note that the same delay on POR is hard-coded.  The default assumes the output of the predivider is 48MHz + 3 percent.  Firmware may scale this setting according to the fastest actual clock frequency that can occur when waking from DeepSleep.</description>

Counting starts internally when this register is written with a nonzero value.  CAL_COUNTER_DONE goes immediately low to indicate that the counter has started and will be asserted when the counters are done.  Do not write this field unless CAL_COUNTER_DONE==1.  Both clocks must be running or the measurement will not complete.  A stalled counter can be recovered by selecting valid clocks, waiting until the measurement completes, and discarding the first result.  CAL_COUNTER1 should always be &gt; 1.  Due to internal clock synchronization CAL_COUNTER1 should be at least 5 times the 1/F_cnt2.</description>

              <description>Action taken if this watchdog when the proper response is written to CRWDT_RESPONSE and  CRWDT_UPCNT  reaches CRWDT_WARN and CRWDT_UPCNT&lt;CRWDT_LATE. WARN_ACTION is ignored (i.e. treated as NOTHING) when a debugger is connected.
For CRWDT_WARN == CRWDT_UPCNT &amp;&amp; CRWDT_LATE &gt; CRWDT_UPCNT: The action is triggered on same edge as when it meets this condition.
For CRWDT_WARN &lt;CRWDT_UPCNT: No action is triggered.

              <description>Pauses/runs this counter while a debugger is connected.  Other behaviors are unchanged during debugging, including service, configuration updates and enable/disable.  Note it may take up to two clk_lf cycles for the counter to pause and another two cycles to unpause, due to internal synchronization.  If the debugger is connected for at least two clk_lf cycles, the EARLY_ACTION is ignored until after the first service after the debugger is disconnected.  This prevents an unintentional trigger of the EARLY_ACTION before the firmware realigns the servicing period.  After the first service, EARLY_ACTION behaves as configured.  If the debugger is disconnected before two clk_lf cycles, the EARLY_ACTION may or may not be ignored.
0: When debugger connected, counter pauses incrementing.
1: When debugger connected, counter increments normally, but reset generation is blocked.

To pause at a breakpoint while debugging, configure the trigger matrix to connect the related CPU halted signal to the trigger input for this WDT, and then set this bit.  It takes up to two clk_lf cycles for the trigger signal to be processed.  Triggers that are less than two clk_lf cycles may be missed.  Synchronization error can accumulate each time it is halted.

During DeepSleep wakeup, the pause request is removed when clk_hf starts clocking, and then it may take up to two clk_lf cycles for the counter to start.  After wakeup, the LOWER_ACTION is ignored until after the first service.  This prevents an unintentional trigger of the LOWER_ACTION before the firmware realigns the servicing period.  After the first service, LOWER_ACTION behaves as configured.
0: Counter behaves normally during DeepSleep.

Note it may take up to two clk_lf cycles for the counter to pause and another two cycles to unpause, due to internal synchronization.  If the debugger is connected for at least two clk_lf cycles, the LOWER_ACTION is ignored until after the first service after the debugger is disconnected.  This prevents an unintentional trigger of the LOWER_ACTION before the firmware realigns the servicing period.  After the first service, LOWER_ACTION behaves as configured.  If the debugger is disconnected before two clk_lf cycles, the LOWER_ACTION may or may not be ignored.
0: When debugger connected, counter pauses incrementing as configured in DEBUG_TRIGGER_EN.
1: When debugger connected, counter increments normally, but reset generation is blocked.</description>

              <description>Each IO port has an associated bit field in this register. The bit field reflects the IO port's interrupt line (bit field i reflects 'interrupts_gpio[i]' for IO port i). The register is used when the system uses a shared/combined interrupt line 'interrupt_gpio'. The SW ISR reads the register to determine which IO port(s) is responsible for the shared/combined interrupt line 'interrupt_gpio'. Once, the IO port(s) is determined, the IO port's INTR register is read to determine the IO pad(s) in the IO port that caused the interrupt.</description>

              <description>Counter enables for counters 0 up to CNT_NR-1.
'0': counter disabled.
'1': counter enabled.
Counter static configuration information (e.g. CTRL.MODE, all TR_CTRL0, TR_CTRL1, and TR_CTRL2 register fields) should only be modified when the counter is disabled. When a counter is disabled, command and status information associated to the counter is cleared by HW, this includes:
- the associated counter triggers in the CMD register are set to '0'.
- the counter's interrupt cause fields in counter's INTR register.
- the counter's status fields in counter's STATUS register..
- the counter's trigger outputs ('tr_overflow', 'tr_underflow' and 'tr_compare_match').
- the counter's line outputs ('line_out' and 'line_compl_out').</description>

In these modes, the kill trigger is used to either temporarily block the PWM outputs (PWM_STOP_ON_KILL is '0') or stop the functionality (PWM_STOP_ON_KILL is '1'). For the PWM and PWM_DT modes, the blocking of the output signals can be  asynchronous (STOP_EDGE should be NO_EDGE_DET) in which case the blocking is as long as the trigger is '1' or synchronous (STOP_EDGE should be RISING_EDGE) in which case it extends till the next terminal count event.</description>

The page size is used to determine the number of Bytes in a page for Flash page based operations (e.g. PGM_PAGE).

Note: the field name FLASH_ROW is misleading, as this field specifies the number of Bytes in a page, rather than the number of Bytes in a row. In a single plane flash macro architecture, a page consists of a single row. However, in a multi plane flash macro architecture, a page consists of multiple rows from different planes.</description>

                <description>Valid indication:
'0': Invalid.
'1': Valid. STATUS.IDX, DATA0, ..., DATA1 specify the fault.

Note: Typically, HW sets this field to '1' (on an activated HW fault source that is 'enabled' by the MASK registers) and SW clears this field to '0' (typically by boot code SW (after a warm system reset, when the fault is handled). In this typical use case scenario, the HW source fault data is simultaneously captured into DATA0, ..., DATA1 when the VALID field is set to '1'. 

An exceptional SW use case scenario is identified as well. In this scenario, SW sets this field to '1' with a fault source index different to one of the defined HW fault sources. SW update is not restricted by the MASK registers). In both use case scenarios, the following holds:
- STATUS.IDX, DATA0, ..., DATA1 can only be written when STATUS.VALID is '0'; the fault structure is not in use yet. Writing STATUS.VALID to '1' effectively locks the fault structure (until SW clears STATUS.VALID to '0'). This restriction requires a SW update to sequentially update the DATA registers followed by an update of the STATUS register.

Note: For the exceptional SW use case, sequential updates to the DATA and STATUS registers may be 'interrupted' by a HW fault capture. In this case, the SW DATA register updates are overwritten by the HW update (and the STATUS.IDX field will reflect the HW capture)</description>

                <description>This interrupt cause field is activated (HW sets the field to '1') when an enabled (MASK0 pending fault source is captured:
- STATUS.VALID is set to '1'.
- STATUS.IDX specifies the fault source index.
- DATA0 through DATA1 captures the fault source data.

SW writes a '1' to this field to clear the interrupt cause to '0'. SW clear STATUS.VALID to '0' to enable capture of the next fault. Note that when there is an enabled pending fault source, the pending fault source is captured immediately and INTR.FAULT is immediately activated (set to '1').</description>

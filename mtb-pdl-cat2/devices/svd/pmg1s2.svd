              <name>ENABLE</name>
              <description>Clock divider enable command (mutually exclusive with DISABLE). Typically, SW sets this field to '1' to enable a divider and HW sets this field to '0' to indicate that divider enabling has completed. When a divider is enabled, its integer and fractional (if present) counters are initialized to '0'. If a divider is to be re-enabled using different integer and fractional divider values, the SW should follow these steps:
0: Disable the divider using the DIV_CMD.DISABLE field.
1: Configure the divider's DIV_XXX_CTL register.
2: Enable the divider using the DIV_CMD_ENABLE field.
 
The SEL_DIV and SEL_TYPE fields specify which divider is to be enabled. The enabled divider may be phase aligned to either 'clk_hf' (typical usage) or to ANY enabled divider.
 
The PA_SEL_DIV and P_SEL_TYPE fields specify the reference divider.
 
The HW sets the ENABLE field to '0' when the enabling is performed and the HW sets the DIV_XXX_CTL.EN field of the divider to '1' when the enabling is performed. Note that enabling with phase alignment to a low frequency divider takes time. E.g. To align to a divider that generates a clock of 'clk_hf'/n (with n being the integer divider value INT_DIV+1), up to n cycles may be required to perform alignment. Phase alignment to 'clk_hf' takes affect immediately. SW can set this field to '0' during phase alignment to abort the enabling process.</description>

If SEL_DIV is '63' and 'SEL_TYPE' is '3' (default/reset value), no divider is specified and no clock control signal(s) are generated.
 
When transitioning a clock between two out of phase dividers, spurious clock control signals may be generated for one 'clk_hf' cycle during this transition. These clock control signals may cause a single clock period that is smaller than any of the two divider periods. To prevent these spurious clock signals, the clock multiplexer can be disconnected (SEL_DIV is '63' and 'SEL_TYPE' is '3') for a transition time that is larger than the smaller of the two divider periods.</description>

For PSoC 4000 CapSense products, set this bit if Vccd is provided externally (on Vccd pin).  Setting this bit turns off the active regulator and will lead to system reset (BOD) unless both Vddd and Vccd pins are supplied externally.  This register bit only resets for XRES, POR, or a detected BOD.</description>

              <description>Regulator over-temp interrupt.  This interrupt can occur when a short circuit exists on the vccd pin or when extreme loads are applied on IO-cells causing the die to overheat.  Firmware is encourage to shutdown all IO cells and then go to DeepSleep mode when this interrupt occurs if protection against such conditions is desired.</description>

The SW ISR reads the register to determine which IO port(s) is responsible for the shared/combined interrupt line 'interrupt_gpio'. Once, the IO port(s) is determined, the IO port's INTR register is read to determine the IO pad(s) in the IO port that caused the interrupt.</description>

'0': Internally clocked mode 
'1': externally clocked mode
 In internally clocked mode, the serial interface protocols run off the SCB clock. In externally clocked mode, the serial interface protocols run off the clock as provided by the serial interface. 

Externally clocked operation mode is only used for synchronous serial interface protocols (SPI and I2C) in slave mode AND EZ mode. In SPI mode, only Motorola submode (all Motorola modes: 0, 1, 2, 3) is supported. The maximum SPI slave, EZ mode bitrate is 48 Mbps (transmission and IO delays outside the IP will degrade the effective bitrate).

In UART mode this field should be '0'.</description>

              <description>Non EZ mode ('0') or EZ mode ('1').
In EZ mode, a meta protocol is applied to the serial interface protocol. This meta protocol adds meaning to the data frames transferred by the serial interface protocol: a data frame can represent a memory address, a write memory data element or a read memory data element. EZ mode is only used for synchronous serial interface protocols: SPI and I2C. In SPI mode, only Motorola submode (all Motorola modes: 0, 1, 2, 3) is supported and the transmitter should use continuous data frames; i.e. data frames not separated by slave deselection. This mode is only applicable to slave functionality. In EZ mode, the slave can read from and write to an addressable memory structure of 32 bytes. In EZ mode, data frames should 8-bit in size and should be transmitted and received with the Most Significant Bit (MSB) first.

In UART mode this field should be '0'.</description>

In I2C mode, this field is used to allow the slave to put the received slave address or general call address in the RX FIFO. Note that a received matching address is put in the RX FIFO when this bit is '1' for both I2C read and write transfers.

In multi-processor UART receiver mode, this field is used to allow the receiver to put the received address in the RX FIFO. Note: non-matching addresses are never put in the RX FIFO.</description>

              <description>SCB block is enabled ('1') or not ('0'). The proper order in which to initialize SCB is as follows:
- Program protocol specific information using SPI_CTRL, UART_CTRL (and UART_TX_CTRL and UART_RX_CTRL) or I2C_CTRL registers. This includes selection of a submode, master/slave functionality and transmitter/receiver functionality when applicable.
- Program generic transmitter (TX_CTRL) and receiver (RX_CTRL) information. This includes enabling of the transmitter and receiver functionality.
- Program transmitter FIFO (TX_FIFO_CTRL) and receiver FIFO (RX_FIFO_CTRL) information.
- Program CTRL register to enable SCB, select the specific operation mode and oversampling factor.
When this block is enabled, no control information should be changed. Changes should be made AFTER disabling this block, e.g. to modify the operation mode (from I2C to SPI) or to go from externally to internally clocked. The change takes effect after the block is re-enabled. Note that disabling the block will cause re-initialization of the design and associated state is lost (e.g. FIFO content).</description>

              <description>Only applicable in standard UART submode. When '1', the receiver performs break detection and baud rate detection on the incoming data. First, break detection counts the amount of bit periods that have a line value of '0'. BREAK_WIDTH specifies the minimum required amount of bit periods. Successful break detection sets the INTR_RX.BREAK_DETECT interrupt cause to '1'. Second, baud rate detection counts the amount of peripheral clock periods that are use to receive the synchronization byte (0x55; least significant bit first). The count is available through UART_RX_STATUS.BR_COUNTER. Successful baud rate detection sets the INTR_RX.BAUD_DETECT interrupt cause to '1' (BR_COUNTER is reliable). This functionality is used to synchronize/refine the receiver clock to the transmitter clock. The receiver software can use the BR_COUNTER value to set the right IP clock (from the programmable clock IP) to guarantee successful receipt of the first LIN data frame (Protected Identifier Field) after the synchronization byte.</description>

The field is only used in master mode. In slave mode, the field is NOT used. However, there is a frequency requirement for the SCB clock wrt. the regular interface (IF) high time to guarantee functional correct behavior. With input signal median filtering, the IF high time should be &gt;= 6 SCB clock cycles and &lt;= 16 SCB clock cycles.

              <description>This field is used during an address match or general call address in internally clocked mode 
Only used when:
 - EC_AM_MODE is '0', EC_OP_MODE is '0', S_GENERAL_IGNORE is '0] and non EZ mode.
Functionality is as follows:
- 1: a received (matching) slave address is immediately NACK'd when the receiver FIFO is full.
- 0: clock stretching is performed (till the receiver FIFO is no longer full). 

For externally clocked logic (EC_AM is '1') on an address match or general call address (and S_GENERAL_IGNORE is '0'). Only used when (NOT used when EC_AM is '1' and EC_OP is '1' and address match and EZ mode):
- EC_AM is '1' and EC_OP is '0'.
- EC_AM is '1' and general call address match.
- EC_AM is '1' and non EZ mode.
Functionality is as follows:
- 1: a received (matching or general) slave address is always immediately NACK'd. There are two possibilities:
       1). the SCB clock is available (in Active system power mode) and it handles the rest of the current transfer. In this case the I2C master will not observe the NACK. 
       2).SCB clock is not present (in DeepSleep system power mode). In this case the I2C master will observe the NACK and may retry the transfer in the future (which gives the internally clocked logic the time to wake up from DeepSleep system power mode). 
- 0: clock stretching is performed (till the SCB clock is available). The logic will handle the ongoing transfer as soon as the clock is enabled.</description>

              <name>BUS_BUSY</name>
              <description>I2C bus is busy. The bus is considered busy ('1'), from the time a START is detected or from the time the SCL line is '0'. The bus is considered idle ('0'), from the time a STOP is detected. If SCB block is disabled, BUS_BUSY is '0'. After enabling the block, it takes time for the BUS_BUSY to detect a busy bus. This time is the maximum high time of the SCL line. For a 100 kHz interface frequency, this maximum high time may last roughly 5 us (half a bit period).

For single master systems, BUS_BUSY does not have to be used to detect an idle bus before a master starts a transfer using I2C_M_CMD.M_START (no bus collisions).

For multi-master systems, BUS_BUSY can be used to detect an idle bus before a master starts a transfer using I2C_M_CMD.M_START_ON_IDLE (to prevent bus collisions).</description>

              <description>When '1', transmit a START or REPEATED START. Whether a START or REPEATED START is transmitted depends on the state of the master state machine. A START is only transmitted when the master state machine is in the default state. A REPEATED START is transmitted when the master state machine is not in the default state, but is working on an ongoing transaction. The REPEATED START can only be transmitted after a NACK or ACK has been received for a transmitted data element or after a NACK has been transmitted for a received data element. When this action is performed, the hardware sets this field to '0'.</description>

For bus idle detection the hardware relies on STOP detection. As a result, bus idle detection is only functional after at least one I2C bus transfer has been detected on the bus (default/reset value of BUSY is '0') . A START is only transmitted when the master state machine is in the default state. When this action is performed, the hardware sets this field to '0'.</description>

This should not occur, it represents erroneous I2C bus behavior. In case of lost arbitration, the I2C slave state machine aborts the ongoing transfer. The Firmware may decide to clear the TX and RX FIFOs in case of this error.</description>

              <description>I2C slave START received. Set to '1', when START or REPEATED START event is detected.

In the case of externally clocked address matching (CTRL.EC_AM_MODE is '1') AND clock stretching is performed (I2C_CTRL.S_NOT_READY_ADDR_NACK is '0'), this field is NOT set. The Firmware should use INTR_S_EC.WAKE_UP, INTR_S.I2C_ADDR_MATCH and INTR_S.I2C_GENERAL.</description>

Counter static configuration information (e.g. CTRL.MODE, all TR_CTRL0, TR_CTRL1, and TR_CTRL2 register fields) should only be modified when the counter is disabled. When a counter is disabled, command and status information associated to the counter is cleared by HW, this includes:
- the associated counter triggers in the CMD register are set to '0'.
- the counter's interrupt cause fields in counter's INTR register.
- the counter's status fields in counter's STATUS register..
- the counter's trigger outputs ('tr_overflow', 'tr_underflow' and 'tr_compare_match').
- the counter's line outputs ('line_out' and 'line_compl_out').</description>

In these modes, the kill trigger is used to either temporarily block the PWM outputs (PWM_STOP_ON_KILL is '0') or stop the functionality (PWM_STOP_ON_KILL is '1'). For the PWM and PWM_DT modes, the blocking of the output signals can be  asynchronous (STOP_EDGE should be NO_EDGE_DET) in which case the blocking is as long as the trigger is '1' or synchronous (STOP_EDGE should be RISING_EDGE) in which case it extends till the next terminal count event.</description>

HW can start an operation through the 'tr_in' input trigger. A rising edge ('0' to '1' transition) on this trigger starts an operation (as specified by CTL.OPCODE). When an operation completes, a two cycle '1' pulse (on 'clk_sys') is generated on the 'tr_out' output trigger.

SW and HW control over the start of an operation should not be mixed.

When an operation is busy (STATUS.BUSY is '1'), no new operation can be started. A SW write to START is ignored and a HW input trigger 'tr_in' rising edge is ignored.</description>

              <description>State of a 32-bit Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSR) that is used to generate a pseudo random bit sequence. This register needs to be initialized by SW. The initialization value should be different from '0'.

The three PR_LFSR_CTL registers represents the state of a 32-bit, 31-bit and 29-bit LFSR. Individually, these LFSRs generate a pseudo random bit sequence that repeats itself after (2^32)-1, (2^31)-1 and (2^29)-1 bits. The numbers (2^32)-1, (2^31)-1 and (2^29)-1 are relatively prime (their greatest common denominator is '1'). The three bit sequence are combined (XOR'd) into a single bitstream to create a pseudo random bit sequence that repeats itself after ((2^32)-1) * ((2^31)-1) * ((2*29)-1) bits.

The following polynomials are used:
- 32-bit irreducible polynomial: x^32+x^30+x^26+x^25+1.
- 31-bit irreducible polynomial: x^31+x^28+1.
- 29-bit irreducible polynomial: x^29+x^27+1.</description>

In addition, it is advised to drop the second 2 samples from the oscillators (to circumvent the semi-predictable oscillator startup behavior). This result in the default field value of '3'. Field encoding is as follows:
'0': 1 sample is dropped.
'1': 2 samples are dropped.
...
'255': 256 samples are dropped.

Note that the corrector produces bits at a random pace and at a frequency that is 1/4 of the reduced bit frequency (reduced bits are processed in pairs, and half of the pairs do NOT produce a bit).</description>

Note that SW can write this field. This functionality can be used prevent information leakage. 

Typically, this field is updated/decremented in the interrupt handler. The interrupt handler decrements the field by the number of consumed bits. If the interrupt handler does NOT update this field (and TR_RESULT.DATA_BIT_SIZE is unchanged), the TR_DATA_AVAILABLE interrupt cause will remain activated. Therefore, proper interrupt based usage is as follows:
- Consume bits from TR_RESULT0.
- Write consumed bits in TR_RESULT0 to '0's (if information leakage needs to prevented).
- Decrement TR_RESULT1 by the number of consumed bits.
- Deactivate INTR.TR_DATA_AVAILABLE.</description>

              <description>When set this bit indicates a valid SETUP packet was received and ACKed. This bit is forced HIGH from the start of the data packet phase of the SETUP transaction until the start of the ACK packet returned by the SIE. The CPU is prevented from clearing this bit during this interval. After this interval the bit will remain set until cleared by firmware. While this bit is set to '1' the CPU cannot write to the EP0_DRx registers. This prevents firmware from overwriting an incoming SETUP transaction before firmware has a chance to read the SETUP data. This bit is cleared by any non-locked writes to the register.</description>

The page size is used to determine the number of Bytes in a page for Flash page based operations (e.g. PGM_PAGE).

Note: the field name FLASH_ROW is misleading, as this field specifies the number of Bytes in a page, rather than the number of Bytes in a row. In a single plane flash macro architecture, a page consists of a single row. However, in a multi plane flash macro architecture, a page consists of multiple rows from different planes.</description>

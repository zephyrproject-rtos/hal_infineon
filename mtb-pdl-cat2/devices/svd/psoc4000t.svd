              <name>ENABLE</name>
              <description>Clock divider enable command (mutually exclusive with DISABLE). Typically, SW sets this field to '1' to enable a divider and HW sets this field to '0' to indicate that divider enabling has completed. When a divider is enabled, its integer and fractional (if present) counters are initialized to '0'. If a divider is to be re-enabled using different integer and fractional divider values, the SW should follow these steps:
0: Disable the divider using the DIV_CMD.DISABLE field.
1: Configure the divider's DIV_XXX_CTL register.
2: Enable the divider using the DIV_CMD_ENABLE field.
 
The SEL_DIV and SEL_TYPE fields specify which divider is to be enabled. The enabled divider may be phase aligned to either 'clk_hf' (typical usage) or to ANY enabled divider.
 
The PA_SEL_DIV and P_SEL_TYPE fields specify the reference divider.
 
The HW sets the ENABLE field to '0' when the enabling is performed and the HW sets the DIV_XXX_CTL.EN field of the divider to '1' when the enabling is performed. Note that enabling with phase alignment to a low frequency divider takes time. E.g. To align to a divider that generates a clock of 'clk_hf'/n (with n being the integer divider value INT_DIV+1), up to n cycles may be required to perform alignment. Phase alignment to 'clk_hf' takes affect immediately. SW can set this field to '0' during phase alignment to abort the enabling process.</description>

If SEL_DIV is '63' and 'SEL_TYPE' is '3' (default/reset value), no divider is specified and no clock control signal(s) are generated.
 
When transitioning a clock between two out of phase dividers, spurious clock control signals may be generated for one 'clk_hf' cycle during this transition. These clock control signals may cause a single clock period that is smaller than any of the two divider periods. To prevent these spurious clock signals, the clock multiplexer can be disconnected (SEL_DIV is '63' and 'SEL_TYPE' is '3') for a transition time that is larger than the smaller of the two divider periods.</description>

                <description>Specifies input trigger. This field is typically set during the setup of a chip use case scenario. Changing this field while activated triggers are present on the input triggers may result in unpredictable behavior. Note that input trigger 0 (default value) is typically connected to a constant signal level of '0', and as a result will not cause HW activation of the output trigger.</description>

              <description>Always write 0 except as noted below. 

For PSoC 4000 CapSense products, set this bit if Vccd is provided externally (on Vccd pin).  Setting this bit turns off the active regulator and will lead to system reset (BOD) unless both Vddd and Vccd pins are supplied externally.  This register bit only resets for XRES, POR, or a detected BOD.</description>

              <description>Delay to wait for references to settle on wakeup from deepsleep.  BOD is ignored and system does not resume until this delay expires. Note that the same delay on POR is hard-coded.  The default assumes the output of the predivider is 48MHz + 3 percent.  Firmware may scale this setting according to the fastest actual clock frequency that can occur when waking from DEEPSLEEP.</description>

              <description>Regulator over-temp interrupt.  This interrupt can occur when a short circuit exists on the vccd pin or when extreme loads are applied on IO-cells causing the die to overheat.  Firmware is encourage to shutdown all IO cells and then go to DeepSleep mode when this interrupt occurs if protection against such conditions is desired.</description>

              <description>Each IO port has an associated bit field in this register. The bit field reflects the IO port's interrupt line (bit field i reflects 'interrupts_gpio[i]' for IO port i). The register is used when the system uses a shared/combined interrupt line 'interrupt_gpio'. The SW ISR reads the register to determine which IO port(s) is responsible for the shared/combined interrupt line 'interrupt_gpio'. Once, the IO port(s) is determined, the IO port's INTR register is read to determine the IO pad(s) in the IO port that caused the interrupt.</description>

For a SW write to the SYSREQ register, the HW will update this field based on the value of SYSCALL_REQ.

SYSCALL_REQ = 0 : the current source of write access is captured.
SYSCALL_REQ = 1 : the previous value (captured when SYSCALL_REQ was 0), is retained/maintained until the next SW write to this register.</description>

              <description>CPU/DAP writes a '1' to this field to request a SystemCall. The HMASTER_0 field indicates the source of the write access. Setting this field to '1' immediate results in a NMI. The SystemCall NMI interrupt handler sets this field to '0' after servicing the request.</description>

The page size is used to determine the number of Bytes in a page for Flash page based operations (e.g. PGM_PAGE).

Note: the field name FLASH_ROW is misleading, as this field specifies the number of Bytes in a page, rather than the number of Bytes in a row. In a single plane flash macro architecture, a page consists of a single row. However, in a multi plane flash macro architecture, a page consists of multiple rows from different planes.</description>

Counter static configuration information (e.g. CTRL.MODE, all TR_CTRL0, TR_CTRL1, and TR_CTRL2 register fields) should only be modified when the counter is disabled. When a counter is disabled, command and status information associated to the counter is cleared by HW, this includes:
- the associated counter triggers in the CMD register are set to '0'.
- the counter's interrupt cause fields in counter's INTR register.
- the counter's status fields in counter's STATUS register..
- the counter's trigger outputs ('tr_overflow', 'tr_underflow' and 'tr_compare_match').
- the counter's line outputs ('line_out' and 'line_compl_out').</description>

A terminal count event is generated when the counter reaches '0', and is changed to a different value AND when the counter reaches PERIOD, and is changed to a different value. (this counter direction can be used for PWM functionality with asymmetrical updates).</description>

                <description>In QUAD mode selects quadrature encoding mode (X1/X2/X4).
In PWM, PWM_DT and PWM_PR modes, these two bits can be used to invert 'dt_line_out' and 'dt_line_compl_out'.  Inversion is the last step in generation of 'dt_line_out' and 'dt_line_compl_out'; i.e. a disabled output line 'dt_line_out' has the value QUADRATURE_MODE[0] and a disabled output line 'dt_line_compl_out' has the value QUADRATURE_MODE[1].</description>

'0': Internally clocked mode

In internally clocked mode, the serial interface protocols run off the SCB clock. In externally clocked mode, the serial interface protocols run off the clock as provided by the serial interface.

The clocking for the rest of the logic is determined by CTRL.EC_OP_MODE.

Externally clocked mode is only used for synchronous serial interface protocols (SPI and I2C) in slave mode. In SPI mode, only Motorola submode (all Motorola modes: 0, 1, 2, 3) is supported.

In UART mode this field should be '0'.</description>

'0': Internally clocked mode 
'1': externally clocked mode
 In internally clocked mode, the serial interface protocols run off the SCB clock. In externally clocked mode, the serial interface protocols run off the clock as provided by the serial interface. 

Externally clocked operation mode is only used for synchronous serial interface protocols (SPI and I2C) in slave mode AND EZ mode. In SPI mode, only Motorola submode (all Motorola modes: 0, 1, 2, 3) is supported. The maximum SPI slave, EZ mode bitrate is 48 Mbps (transmission and IO delays outside the IP will degrade the effective bitrate).

In UART mode this field should be '0'.</description>

              <description>Non EZ mode ('0') or EZ mode ('1').
In EZ mode, a meta protocol is applied to the serial interface protocol. This meta protocol adds meaning to the data frames transferred by the serial interface protocol: a data frame can represent a memory address, a write memory data element or a read memory data element. EZ mode is only used for synchronous serial interface protocols: SPI and I2C. In SPI mode, only Motorola submode (all Motorola modes: 0, 1, 2, 3) is supported and the transmitter should use continuous data frames; i.e. data frames not separated by slave deselection. This mode is only applicable to slave functionality. In EZ mode, the slave can read from and write to an addressable memory structure of 32 bytes. In EZ mode, data frames should 8-bit in size and should be transmitted and received with the Most Significant Bit (MSB) first.

In UART mode this field should be '0'.</description>

              <description>Determines whether a received matching address is accepted in the RX FIFO ('1') or not ('0').

In I2C mode, this field is used to allow the slave to put the received slave address or general call address in the RX FIFO. Note that a received matching address is put in the RX FIFO when this bit is '1' for both I2C read and write transfers.

In multi-processor UART receiver mode, this field is used to allow the receiver to put the received address in the RX FIFO. Note: non-matching addresses are never put in the RX FIFO.</description>

IF BLOCK is '0' and the accesses collide, CPU read operations return 0xffff:ffff and CPU write operations are ignored. Colliding accesses are registered as interrupt causes: INTR_TX.BLOCKED and INTR_RX.BLOCKED.</description>

              <description>SCB block is enabled ('1') or not ('0'). The proper order in which to initialize SCB is as follows:
- Program protocol specific information using SPI_CTRL, UART_CTRL (and UART_TX_CTRL and UART_RX_CTRL) or I2C_CTRL registers. This includes selection of a submode, master/slave functionality and transmitter/receiver functionality when applicable.
- Program generic transmitter (TX_CTRL) and receiver (RX_CTRL) information. This includes enabling of the transmitter and receiver functionality.
- Program transmitter FIFO (TX_FIFO_CTRL) and receiver FIFO (RX_FIFO_CTRL) information.
- Program CTRL register to enable SCB, select the specific operation mode and oversampling factor.
Generally when this block is enabled, no control information should be changed. Changes should be made AFTER disabling this block, e.g. to modify the operation mode (from I2C to SPI) or to go from externally to internally clocked. The change takes effect after the block is re-enabled. Note that disabling the block will cause re-initialization of the design and associated state is lost (e.g. FIFO content).

Specific to SPI master case,  when SCB is idle,  below registers can be changed without disabling SCB block,

When continuous transfers are enabled individual data frame transfers are not necessarily separated by slave deselection (as indicated by the level or pulse on the SELECT line): if the TX FIFO has multiple data frames, data frames are send out without slave deselection.

When continuous transfers are not enabled individual data frame transfers are always separated by slave deselection: independent of the availability of TX FIFO data frames, data frames are sent out with slave deselection.</description>

              <description>SPI bus is busy. The bus is considered busy ('1') during an ongoing transaction. For Motorola and National submodes, the busy bit is '1', when the slave selection is activated. For TI submode, the busy bit is '1' from the time the preceding/coinciding slave select is activated for the first transmitted data frame, till the last MOSI/MISO bit of the last data frame is transmitted.</description>

              <description>Only applicable in standard UART submode. When '1', the receiver performs break detection and baud rate detection on the incoming data. First, break detection counts the amount of bit periods that have a line value of '0'. BREAK_WIDTH specifies the minimum required amount of bit periods. Successful break detection sets the INTR_RX.BREAK_DETECT interrupt cause to '1'. Second, baud rate detection counts the amount of peripheral clock periods that are use to receive the synchronization byte (0x55; least significant bit first). The count is available through UART_RX_STATUS.BR_COUNTER. Successful baud rate detection sets the INTR_RX.BAUD_DETECT interrupt cause to '1' (BR_COUNTER is reliable). This functionality is used to synchronize/refine the receiver clock to the transmitter clock. The receiver software can use the BR_COUNTER value to set the right IP clock (from the programmable clock IP) to guarantee successful receipt of the first LIN data frame (Protected Identifier Field) after the synchronization byte.</description>

              <description>Serial I2C interface high phase oversampling factor. HIGH_PHASE_OVS + 1 SCB clock periods constitute the high phase of a bit period. The valid range is [5, 15] with input signal median filtering and [4, 15] without input signal median filtering.

The field is only used in master mode. In slave mode, the field is NOT used. However, there is a frequency requirement for the SCB clock wrt. the regular interface (IF) high time to guarantee functional correct behavior. With input signal median filtering, the IF high time should be &gt;= 6 SCB clock cycles and &lt;= 16 SCB clock cycles. Without input signal median filtering, the IF high time should be &gt;= 5 SCB clock cycles and &lt;= 16 SCB clock cycles.</description>

              <description>Serial I2C interface low phase oversampling factor. LOW_PHASE_OVS + 1 SCB clock periods constitute the low phase of a bit period. The valid range is [7, 15] with input signal median filtering and [6, 15] without input signal median filtering. 

The field is only used in master mode. In slave mode, the field is NOT used. However, there is a frequency requirement for the SCB clock wrt. the regular (no stretching) interface (IF) low time to guarantee functionally correct behavior. With input signal median filtering, the IF low time should be &gt;= 8 SCB clock cycles and &lt;= 16 IP clock cycles. Without input signal median filtering, the IF low time should be &gt;= 7 SCB clock cycles and &lt;= 16 SCB clock cycles.

in slave mode, this field is used to define number of clk_scb cycles for tSU-DAT timing (from ACK/NACK/data ready, to SCL rising edge (released from I2C slave clock stretching))</description>

              <description>This field is used during an address match or general call address in internally clocked mode 
Only used when:
 - EC_AM_MODE is '0', EC_OP_MODE is '0', S_GENERAL_IGNORE is '0] and non EZ mode.
Functionality is as follows:
- 1: a received (matching) slave address is immediately NACK'd when the receiver FIFO is full.
- 0: clock stretching is performed (till the receiver FIFO is no longer full). 

For externally clocked logic (EC_AM is '1') on an address match or general call address (and S_GENERAL_IGNORE is '0'). Only used when (NOT used when EC_AM is '1' and EC_OP is '1' and address match and EZ mode):
- EC_AM is '1' and EC_OP is '0'.
- EC_AM is '1' and general call address match.
- EC_AM is '1' and non EZ mode.
Functionality is as follows:
- 1: a received (matching or general) slave address is always immediately NACK'd. There are two possibilities:
       1). the SCB clock is available (in Active system power mode) and it handles the rest of the current transfer. In this case the I2C master will not observe the NACK. 
       2).SCB clock is not present (in DeepSleep system power mode). In this case the I2C master will observe the NACK and may retry the transfer in the future (which gives the internally clocked logic the time to wake up from DeepSleep system power mode). 
- 0: clock stretching is performed (till the SCB clock is available). The logic will handle the ongoing transfer as soon as the clock is enabled.</description>

              <name>BUS_BUSY</name>
              <description>I2C bus is busy. The bus is considered busy ('1'), from the time a START is detected or from the time the SCL line is '0'. The bus is considered idle ('0'), from the time a STOP is detected. If SCB block is disabled, BUS_BUSY is '0'. After enabling the block, it takes time for the BUS_BUSY to detect a busy bus. This time is the maximum high time of the SCL line. For a 100 kHz interface frequency, this maximum high time may last roughly 5 us (half a bit period).

For single master systems, BUS_BUSY does not have to be used to detect an idle bus before a master starts a transfer using I2C_M_CMD.M_START (no bus collisions).

For multi-master systems, BUS_BUSY can be used to detect an idle bus before a master starts a transfer using I2C_M_CMD.M_START_ON_IDLE (to prevent bus collisions).</description>

              <description>When '1', transmit a START or REPEATED START. Whether a START or REPEATED START is transmitted depends on the state of the master state machine. A START is only transmitted when the master state machine is in the default state. A REPEATED START is transmitted when the master state machine is not in the default state, but is working on an ongoing transaction. The REPEATED START can only be transmitted after a NACK or ACK has been received for a transmitted data element or after a NACK has been transmitted for a received data element. When this action is performed, the hardware sets this field to '0'.</description>

For bus idle detection the hardware relies on STOP detection. As a result, bus idle detection is only functional after at least one I2C bus transfer has been detected on the bus (default/reset value of BUSY is '0') . A START is only transmitted when the master state machine is in the default state. When this action is performed, the hardware sets this field to '0'.</description>

DATA_WIDTH + 1 is the amount of bits in a transmitted data frame. 
This number does not include start, parity and stop bits. 
For UART mode, the valid range is [3, 8]. 
For SPI, the valid range is [3, 31]. 
For I2C the only valid value is 7.
In EZ mode (for both SPI and I2C), the only valid value is 7.</description>

              <description>Each IO cell 'xxx' has two associated IP output signals 'xxx_out_en' and 'xxx_out'.
'0': Normal operation mode. Typically, this operation mode is used for IO cells that are connected to (board) wires/lines that are driven by a single IO cell. In this operation mode, for an IO cell 'xxx' that is used as an output, the 'xxx_out_en' output enable signal is typically constant '1' the 'xxx_out' output is the outputted value. In other words, in normal operation mode, the 'xxx_out' output is used to control the IO cell output value: 'xxx_out' is '0' to drive an IO cell output value of '0' and 'xxx_out' is '1' to drive an IO cell output value of '1'.
'1': Open drain operation mode. Typically this operation mode is used for IO cells that are connected to (board) wires/lines that are driven by multiple IO cells (possibly on multiple chips). In this operation mode, for and IO cell 'xxx' that is used as an output, the 'xxx_out_en' output controls the outputted value. Typically, open drain operation mode drives low/'0' and the 'xxx_out' output is constant '1'. In other words, in open drain operation mode, the 'xxx_out_en' output is used to control the IO cell output value: in drive low/'0' mode: 'xxx_out_en' is '1' (drive enabled) to drive an IO cell output value of '0' and 'xxx_out_en' is '1' (drive disabled) to not drive an IO cell output value (another IO cell can drive the wire/line or a pull up results in a wire/line value '1').

The open drain mode is supported for:
- UART mode, 'uart_tx' IO cell.
- SPI mode, 'spi_miso' IO cell.

this bit is not applicable to I2C mode, 'i2c_scl' and 'i2c_sda' IO cells.</description>

this bit is applicable to I2C SCL only.
I2C SDA always work in open-drain mode.

this is not applicable to M0S8, which does not need special control in SCB for open-drain drive mode.</description>

A read from an empty RX FIFO sets INTR_RX.UNDERFLOW to '1'.

When this register is read through the debugger, the data frame will not be removed from the FIFO. Similar in operation to RX_FIFO_RD_SILENT</description>

              <description>I2C slave lost arbitration: the value driven on the SDA line is not the same as the value observed on the SDA line (while the SCL line is '1'). This should not occur, it represents erroneous I2C bus behavior. In case of lost arbitration, the I2C slave state machine aborts the ongoing transfer. The Firmware may decide to clear the TX and RX FIFOs in case of this error.</description>

              <description>Starting 32-bit word address offset index from SNS_LP_AOS_SNS_CTL0 register for each sensor configuration structure in local IP storage SENSOR_DATA. The difference between this CFG_OFFSET index and the index of SNS_CTL (index of 0xd addresses from SNS_LP_AOS_SNS_CTL0) defines the size of each configuration structure in SENSOR_DATA and the group of registers that change autonomously from sensor to sensor when scanning in AS_MS or LP_AOS modes. This setting is used by hardware when reading from local memory and programming IP registers - the logic will load from the memory from this starting offset and store into the SNS_* registers up to and including SNS_CTL. For example, setting this value to 0xb means that each configuration structure starts from SNS_SCAN_CTL (and all SNS_* registers up to and including SNS_CTL, so the configuration structure in SENSOR_DATA is 3x 32-bit words per sensor).

Firmware Rule: If using AS_MS/LP_AOS mode and engaging the Channel Engine (CE_CTL.ENABLED = 1), then CFG_OFFSET must be set to 0x0 since the Channel Engine related registers are offset from here (SNS_LP_AOS_SENSOR_CTL0).</description>

              <description>The duration of EPILOGUE defined in relation to Kref when (LFSR_MODE = PRS). The value is interpreted as Kref/4 increments. Kref is defined via SENSE_DIV.

Duration of EPILOGUE calculated as:
T_PRO_WAIT = NUM_EPI_KREF_DELAY_PRS*CEIL[(Kref)/4]

This allows a range of [1, 255] which translates to [0.25Kref, 63.75Kref].

Firmware Rule:
Note that setting this register to 0 is an illegal configuration. Recommended programming value is 96.</description>

              <description>Select value for  Dither/Flatspot CAPDAC size.

If dithering is enabled (FL_MODE = DITHER), this is the seed value for the LFSR.

If FL_MODE = OFFSET, this value is presented directly to the hard IP as the CAPDAC code. 

If FL_MODE = OFF, this value is ignored and 0x00 is presented to the hard IP.

Firmware Rule: If FL_MODE = DITHER, SEL_FL != 0 since it seeds the LFSR. Likely default seed is 0xFF.</description>

              <name>MRSS_PWR_CYCLE_EN</name>
              <description>Control bit to enable/disable hardware controlled power cycling of MRSS resources (reference, IMO, pump). This power cycling occurs at the end of frames initiated via FRAME_START_AOS that do not result in an interrupt. By default this is enabled to achieve maximum power savings. Note that independent of MRSS_PWR_CYCLE_EN, the MSCLP analog circuit is also disabled at the same time as the MRSS (even though CTL.ENABLED = 1). This autonomous disabling of the hard IP has the same effect as CTL.ENABLED = 0.

Firmware Rule: Hardware power cycling must be disabled if firmware intends on accessing any MMIO in SNS_STRUCTLP during a time window when the AoS FSM is active. This is because the MMIO on SNS_STRUCTLP are clocked on the local IMO. If an access to this MMIO bank occurs while the IMO is power cycled, the transaction will be lost and the bridge cannot respond to this transaction.</description>

              <description>MSCLP logic has turned on the MRSS IMO.

Firmware Rule:
CTL.ENABLED = 0 does not reset the cause for this interrupt. This is because CTL.ENABLED must be 0 when booting up the MRSS via firmware. Once IMO_UP is detected, CTL.ENABLED can be set to 1 to release reset to tbe block synchronously to the newly started MRSS IMO.</description>

              <description>Stop the MRSS pump resource. The ability to shut off the MRSS pump allows for power saving when MSCLP is in a standby state (CTL.ENABLED = 0) not scanning and hence no pump is needed. In this case the MRSS reference and IMO remain on so firmware may access MMIO in the SNS_STRUCTLP register bank. MRSS_STOP is used in the case where the entire MRSS is to be shut down.</description>

                <description>Local IP storage to support per-sensor configuration and results for AS-MS/LP-AoS mode. The per sensor registers all have the prefix SNS_* in the SNS_STRUCTLP register tab.

Firmware Rule:
Firmware must program the following registers in a manner to allow for SENSOR_DATA to be used for both purposes (configuration and result).

Sensor configuration:
FRAME_CFG_START_ADDR is set by software to indicate to hardware where the first sensor scan configuration structure exists in SENSOR_DATA to start processing a frame (typically set to 0x0). The size of each configuration structure depends on what software sets for CFG_OFFSET (see description of this register for more details). Autonomous scanning will execute sequential structures (size defined by CFG_OFFSET) until it encounters a structure with SNS_CTL.LAST set. This defines the end of the frame.

Sensor results:
FRAME_RES_START_ADDR is set by software to define the base address (in 32-bit words) of the result FIFO (where the frame raw counts are stored). The depth of the FIFO is inferred by the setting for FRAME_RES_START_ADDR and the size of the memory integrated by the IP. For example if 1kB is available, there are 256x 32-bit entries in SENSOR_DATA (0-&gt;255). If FRAME_RES_START_ADDR is set to 224, then the FIFO depth = 255-224+1 = 32. The result data is directly accessible by firmware via SENSOR_DATA (with an understanding of FRAME_RES_START_ADDR to know which index in SENSOR_DATA to access). The result FIFO can also be accessed as a FIFO via RESULT_FIFO_RD, which always points to the head of the FIFO (as tracked by hardware) and a read to this register pops the top result off this FIFO. See description of RESULT_FIFO_RD for details.

Note that depending on the size of the SRAM macro integrated with the IP, and the amount of sensors being scanned (and amount of autonomous configuration required) - it is possible to have multiple sets of frame configuration and/or have the result FIFO sized to store multiple frames of data.</description>

                <description>The ratio (minus 1) of clk_comp::clk_mod.

Notes for tuning:
Fs = Fmod / Kref
Fcomp = Kcomp * Fs

MSCLP MMIO provides:
Kref = (SENSE_DIV+1)
Fs = Fmod/(SENSE_DIV+1)
Fcomp = Fmod / (COMP_DIV+1)

Therefore:
Kcomp = Fmod/[Fs*(COMP_DIV+1)]

Kcomp = (SENSE_DIV+1)/(COMP_DIV+1)


Firmware Rule: It is expected that Kcomp be programmed as an integer. Anything else is considered a mis-programming.</description>

                <description>Compensation blanking control. Type of blanking controlled by COMP_BLANKING_MODE.

The time window in which these effects apply depend on the following.

When enabled and in Direct Clock and Spread Spectrum mode (LFSR_MODE):

2-Phase:
50 percent Comp:
PH0: Enable Comp for (SENSE_DIV+1)/4 (this will be 0.5 of Ph0 phase)
PH1: Enable Comp for (SENSE_DIV+1)/4 (this will be 0.5 of Ph1 phase)
25 percent Comp:
PH0: Enable Comp for (SENSE_DIV+1)/8 (this will be 0.25 of Ph0 phase)
PH1: Enable Comp for (SENSE_DIV+1)/8 (this will be 0.25 of Ph1 phase)

4-Phase:
50 percent Comp:
PH1: Enable Comp for (SENSE_DIV+1)/4 (this will be Full of Ph1 phase)
PH3: Enable Comp for (SENSE_DIV+1)/4 (this will be Full of Ph3 phase)
25 percent Comp:
PH1: Enable Comp for (SENSE_DIV+1)/8 (this will be 0.5 of Ph1 phase)
PH3: Enable Comp for (SENSE_DIV+1)/8 (this will be 0.5 of Ph3 phase)

Note that in Spread Spectrum mode, if the ph* where compensation is on shrinks from the nominal. So, if we have 50 percent compensation the ph can shrink to be shorter than (SENSE_DIV+1)/4. So for example if ph1 shrinks, this will mean that compensation stays on a bit into ph2. This is OK.

When enabled and in PRS mode (LFSR_MODE):

2-Phase PRS:
50 percent Comp:
PH0: Enable Comp for (SENSE_DIV+1) (this will be 0.5 of AVG Ph0 and All of MIN Ph0)
PH1: Enable Comp for (SENSE_DIV+1) (this will be 0.5 of AVG Ph1 and All of MIN Ph1)
25 percent Comp:
PH0: Enable Comp for (SENSE_DIV+1)/2 (this will be 0.25 of AVG Ph0 and 0.5 of Min Ph0)
PH1: Enable Comp for (SENSE_DIV+1)/2 (this will be 0.25 of AVG Ph1 and 0.5 of Min Ph1)

4-Phase PRS:
50 percent Comp:
PH1: Enable Comp for (SENSE_DIV+1)*2 (this will be All of AVG Ph1 and 2x of Min Ph1 or All of Min Ph1+Min Ph2)
PH3: Enable Comp for (SENSE_DIV+1)*2 (this will be All of AVG Ph3 and 2x of Min Ph3 or All of Min Ph3+Min Ph0)
25 percent Comp:
PH1: Enable Comp for (SENSE_DIV+1) (this will be 0.5 of AVG Ph1 and All of Min Ph1)
PH3: Enable Comp for (SENSE_DIV+1) (this will be 0.5 of AVG Ph3 and All of Min Ph3)</description>

                <description>Start the MSCLP sequencer frame process. Note that a rising edge on this bit also creates a 4x cycle clk_msc pulse on the msc_ext_frm_start_out signal (when EXT_FRAME_START_MODE = DISABLED). The corresponding msc_ext_frm_start_out_en is controlled by CTL.ENABLED.

Sequencer FSM clears this bit on egress from IDLE. If START_FRAME is set by firmware when FSM is not in IDLE, the hardware must hold the bit set to allow for 'pending' frame behaviour.

Firmware Rule:
Note if FRAME_CMD is used in a multi-channel scenario care must be taken by firmware not to excessively delay FRAME_CMD to each individual channel. If not, a window exists where the first channel that sees FRAME_CMD can reach the WAIT_CONSENSUS state and mistakenly believe all channels are ready for lockstep scanning when the reality is the other channels are still in IDLE and indicating ready because they haven't been initiated yet.</description>

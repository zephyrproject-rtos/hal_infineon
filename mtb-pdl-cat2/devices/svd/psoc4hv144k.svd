              <name>ENABLE</name>
              <description>Clock divider enable command (mutually exclusive with DISABLE). Typically, SW sets this field to '1' to enable a divider and HW sets this field to '0' to indicate that divider enabling has completed. When a divider is enabled, its integer and fractional (if present) counters are initialized to '0'. If a divider is to be re-enabled using different integer and fractional divider values, the SW should follow these steps:
0: Disable the divider using the DIV_CMD.DISABLE field.
1: Configure the divider's DIV_XXX_CTL register.
2: Enable the divider using the DIV_CMD_ENABLE field.
 
The SEL_DIV and SEL_TYPE fields specify which divider is to be enabled. The enabled divider may be phase aligned to either 'clk_hf' (typical usage) or to ANY enabled divider.
 
The PA_SEL_DIV and P_SEL_TYPE fields specify the reference divider.
 
The HW sets the ENABLE field to '0' when the enabling is performed and the HW sets the DIV_XXX_CTL.EN field of the divider to '1' when the enabling is performed. Note that enabling with phase alignment to a low frequency divider takes time. E.g. To align to a divider that generates a clock of 'clk_hf'/n (with n being the integer divider value INT_DIV+1), up to n cycles may be required to perform alignment. Phase alignment to 'clk_hf' takes affect immediately. SW can set this field to '0' during phase alignment to abort the enabling process.</description>

If SEL_DIV is '63' and 'SEL_TYPE' is '3' (default/reset value), no divider is specified and no clock control signal(s) are generated.
 
When transitioning a clock between two out of phase dividers, spurious clock control signals may be generated for one 'clk_hf' cycle during this transition. These clock control signals may cause a single clock period that is smaller than any of the two divider periods. To prevent these spurious clock signals, the clock multiplexer can be disconnected (SEL_DIV is '63' and 'SEL_TYPE' is '3') for a transition time that is larger than the smaller of the two divider periods.</description>

                <description>Specifies input trigger. This field is typically set during the setup of a chip use case scenario. Changing this field while activated triggers are present on the input triggers may result in unpredictable behavior. Note that input trigger 0 (default value) is typically connected to a constant signal level of '0', and as a result will not cause HW activation of the output trigger.</description>

Counting starts internally when this register is written with a nonzero value.  CAL_COUNTER_DONE goes immediately low to indicate that the counter has started and will be asserted when the counters are done.  Do not write this field unless CAL_COUNTER_DONE==1.  Both clocks must be running or the measurement will not complete.  A stalled counter can be recovered by selecting valid clocks, waiting until the measurement completes, and discarding the first result.  CAL_COUNTER1 should always be &gt; 1.  Due to internal clock synchronization CAL_COUNTER1 should be at least 5 times the 1/F_cnt2.</description>

              <description>Pauses/runs this counter while a debugger is connected.  Other behaviors are unchanged during debugging, including service, configuration updates and enable/disable.  Note it may take up to two clk_lf cycles for the counter to pause and another two cycles to unpause, due to internal synchronization.  If the debugger is connected for at least two clk_lf cycles, the EARLY_ACTION is ignored until after the first service after the debugger is disconnected.  This prevents an unintentional trigger of the EARLY_ACTION before the firmware realigns the servicing period.  After the first service, EARLY_ACTION behaves as configured.  If the debugger is disconnected before two clk_lf cycles, the EARLY_ACTION may or may not be ignored.
0: When debugger connected, counter pauses incrementing.
1: When debugger connected, counter increments normally, but reset generation is blocked.

To pause at a breakpoint while debugging, configure the trigger matrix to connect the related CPU halted signal to the trigger input for this WDT, and then set this bit.  It takes up to two clk_lf cycles for the trigger signal to be processed.  Triggers that are less than two clk_lf cycles may be missed.  Synchronization error can accumulate each time it is halted.

During DeepSleep wakeup, the pause request is removed when clk_hf starts clocking, and then it may take up to two clk_lf cycles for the counter to start.  After wakeup, the LOWER_ACTION is ignored until after the first service.  This prevents an unintentional trigger of the LOWER_ACTION before the firmware realigns the servicing period.  After the first service, LOWER_ACTION behaves as configured.
0: Counter behaves normally during DeepSleep.

Note it may take up to two clk_lf cycles for the counter to pause and another two cycles to unpause, due to internal synchronization.  If the debugger is connected for at least two clk_lf cycles, the LOWER_ACTION is ignored until after the first service after the debugger is disconnected.  This prevents an unintentional trigger of the LOWER_ACTION before the firmware realigns the servicing period.  After the first service, LOWER_ACTION behaves as configured.  If the debugger is disconnected before two clk_lf cycles, the LOWER_ACTION may or may not be ignored.
0: When debugger connected, counter pauses incrementing as configured in DEBUG_TRIGGER_EN.
1: When debugger connected, counter increments normally, but reset generation is blocked.</description>

              <description>PILO enable.  Setting this bit will enable the PILO and clearing this bit will disable it.  Do not disable this clock prior to changing  CLK_LF to use the PILO as a source.  CLK_LF must be configured to use PILO as a source while the PILO clock is enabled prior to making such a change.   Writes to this field are ignored when LFCLK_SEL is using this clock as the source and WDT is locked using WDT_LOCK register.  Consequently, if CLK_LF is sourced by the PILO and the PILO is to be disabled, clear WDT_LOCK before-hand. This register field resets with hard reset (power related, XRES, WDT).</description>

              <description>Each IO port has an associated bit field in this register. The bit field reflects the IO port's interrupt line (bit field i reflects 'interrupts_gpio[i]' for IO port i). The register is used when the system uses a shared/combined interrupt line 'interrupt_gpio'. The SW ISR reads the register to determine which IO port(s) is responsible for the shared/combined interrupt line 'interrupt_gpio'. Once, the IO port(s) is determined, the IO port's INTR register is read to determine the IO pad(s) in the IO port that caused the interrupt.</description>

'0': CPU write access.
'1': DAP write access.

For a SW write to the SYSREQ register, the HW will update this field based on the value of SYSCALL_REQ.

SYSCALL_REQ = 0 : the current source of write access is captured.
SYSCALL_REQ = 1 : the previous value (captured when SYSCALL_REQ was 0), is retained/maintained until the next SW write to this register.</description>

              <description>CPU/DAP writes a '1' to this field to request a SystemCall. The HMASTER_0 field indicates the source of the write access. Setting this field to '1' immediate results in a NMI. The SystemCall NMI interrupt handler sets this field to '0' after servicing the request.</description>

              <description>0': IP is disabled. Non-retainable MMIO registers and logic functionality are reset (retainable MMIO registers are NOT reset):
- INTR register is set to '0'.
- DW/DMA functionality is aborted.
- DW/DMA controller input/pending triggers are de-activated.
- DW/DMA controller output triggers are de-activated.
Disabling the IP has the same effect as an active 'rst_sys_act_n' reset in DeepSleep power mode. To prevent a loss of active (pending) DW/DMA triggers when disabling the IP or when transitioning from Active to DeepSleep power mode, the STATUS.ACTIVE and STATUS_CH_ACT.CH fields can be used.

Note that most MMIO registers are retainable, and a transition from DeepSleep to Active/Sleep power modes makes the DW/DMA controller operational, and ready to react to DW/DMA input triggers that are activated after the transition. Triggers are Active/Sleep functionality.
'1': IP is enabled.</description>

                <description>Specifies whether the data transfer engine should wait for the channel to be deactivated; i.e. the selected system trigger is not active. This field is used to synchronize the controller's data transfer(s) with the agent that generated the trigger. This field is ONLY used at the completion of an opcode. E.g., a FIFO indicates that it is empty and it needs a new data sample. The agent removes the trigger ONLY when the data sample has been written by the transfer engine AND received by the agent.  Furthermore, the agent's trigger may be delayed by a few cycles before it reaches the DW/DMA controller. This field is used for level sensitive trigger, which reflect state (pulse sensitive triggers should have this field set to '0'). The wait cycles incurred by this field reduce DW/DMA controller performance.
'0': Do not wait for de-activation (for pulse sensitive triggers).
'1': Wait for up to 4 cycles.
'2': Wait for up to 8 cycles.
'3': Wait indefinitely. This option may result in DW/DMA controller lockup if the system trigger is not de-activated by the source agent.</description>

In DMA mode (OPCODE is '1' or '2'), multi data element transfers are constructed out of multiple single data element load (from the source location) and store (to the destination location) sequences. This field allows higher priority activated channels to preempt the current transfer in between these atomic (load, store) sequences. Preemption will NOT deactivate the current channel. As a result, after completion of a higher priority activated channel, the current channel is rescheduled.</description>

                <name>OPCODE</name>
                <description>Specifies the specific data transfer (only when the VALID bit of the descriptor's STATUS word is '1'):

'0': A single trigger initiates a single data element transfer (DW mode). This opcode specifies a transfer of a single data element. The current descriptor is completed when the amount of transferred single data elements equals the programmed buffer size (DATA_NR+1).

'1': A single trigger initiates a single descriptor transfer (DMA mode). This opcode specifies a transfer of DATA_NR+1 data elements as specified by the current descriptor structure. The current descriptor is completed when its data transfer is completed.

'2': A single trigger initiates a descriptor list transfer (DMA mode). This opcode specifies a transfer of DATA_NR+1 data elements as specified by the current descriptor structure and by successive valid descriptors. The current descriptor is completed when its data transfer is completed. This OPCODE relies on FLIPPING to be set to '1', such that the CH_CTLi.PING_PONG field is flipped/inverted and the successive descriptor is used. This continues for as long as the successive descriptor is valid. Note that as the HW is using the PING/PONG descriptor, the SW can prepare the alternate PONG/PING descriptor. The interrupt mechanism is used by HW to convey to the SW that the current descriptor is completed (and can be prepared for a successive transfer).

After completion of the opcode (and waiting for de-activation, the channel's output trigger is activated).</description>

                <description>Specifies the index of the current data transfer. This value increases from 0 to CONTROL.DATA_NR. HW sets this field:
- When a descriptor is done (RESPONSE is DONE), the field is set to '0' when PING_CTL.INV_DESCR is '0' and the field is set to PING_CTL.DATA_NR when PING_CTL.INV_DESCR is '1'.
- When a descriptor is not done (RESPONSE is NO_ERROR), the field reflects the progress of a data transfer.
- In case of erroneous behavior (RESPONSE is neither DONE or NO_ERROR), the field is not updated, but keeps its value to ease debugging.
HW only modifies this field for an active descriptor (STATUS.VALID to be '1'). At descriptor initialization, SW should set this field to '0'. 

This field allows software to read the progress of the data transfer. Note that SRC.ADDR and DST.ADDR represent base addresses and are not modified during data transfer. However, STATUS.CURR_DATA_NR is modified during data transfer and provides an offset wrt. the base addresses.</description>

                <description>Response code (the first two codes NO_ERROR and DONE are the result of normal behavior, the other codes are the result of erroneous behavior).
'0'/NO_ERROR: No error. Setting this response does NOT set the interrupt cause bit to '1'. STATUS.VALID is NOT affected. CH_CTLi.ENABLED is NOT affected. CH_CTLi.PING_PONG is not updated. This response is used for an unused or not completed descriptor. Software should set the RESPONSE field to '0'/NO_ERROR during descriptor initialization.
'1'/DONE: Descriptor is done (without errors). Setting this response sets the interrupt cause bit to '1' if CONTROL.SET_CAUSE is '1'. STATUS.VALID is set to '0' if CONTROL.INV_DESCR is '1'. CH_CTLi.ENABLED is NOT affected. CH_CTLi.PING_PONG is updated if CONTROL.FLIPPING is '1'.
'2'/SRC_BUS_ERROR: Bus error while loading data from the source location. Setting this response sets the interrupt cause bit to '1'. STATUS.VALID is set '0'. CH_CTLi.ENABLED is set to '0'. CH_CTLi.PING_PONG is not updated (it identifies the descriptor that caused the error).
'3'/DST_BUS_ERROR: Bus error while storing data to the destination location. Setting this response sets the interrupt cause bit to '1'. STATUS.VALID is set '0'. CH_CTLi.ENABLED is set to '0'. CH_CTLi.PING_PONG is not updated (it identifies the descriptor that caused the error).
'4'/SRC_MISAL: Misalignment of source address. This occurs on a 16-bit bus transfer that is not 2-byte aligned or on a 32-bit bus transfer that is not 4-byte aligned. Setting this response sets the interrupt cause bit to '1'. STATUS.VALID is set '0'. CH_CTLi.ENABLED is set to '0'. CH_CTLi.PING_PONG is not updated (it identifies the descriptor that caused the error).
'5'/DST_MISAL: Misalignment of destination address. This occurs on a 16-bit bus transfer that is not 2-byte aligned or on a 32-bit bus transfer that is not 4-byte aligned. Setting this response sets the interrupt cause bit to '1'. STATUS.VALID is set '0'. CH_CTLi.ENABLED is set to '0'. CH_CTLi.PING_PONG is not updated (it identifies the descriptor that caused the error).
'6'/INVALID_DESCR: Invalid descriptor (STATUS.VALID is '0'). This occurs when an activated channel has an invalid descriptor. CH_CTLi.ENABLED is set to '0'. CH_CTLi.PING_PONG is not updated (it identifies the descriptor that caused the error).</description>

                <description>Valid indication:
'0': Invalid.
'1': Valid. STATUS.IDX, DATA0, ..., DATA1 specify the fault.

Note: Typically, HW sets this field to '1' (on an activated HW fault source that is 'enabled' by the MASK registers) and SW clears this field to '0' (typically by boot code SW (after a warm system reset, when the fault is handled). In this typical use case scenario, the HW source fault data is simultaneously captured into DATA0, ..., DATA1 when the VALID field is set to '1'. 

An exceptional SW use case scenario is identified as well. In this scenario, SW sets this field to '1' with a fault source index different to one of the defined HW fault sources. SW update is not restricted by the MASK registers). In both use case scenarios, the following holds:
- STATUS.IDX, DATA0, ..., DATA1 can only be written when STATUS.VALID is '0'; the fault structure is not in use yet. Writing STATUS.VALID to '1' effectively locks the fault structure (until SW clears STATUS.VALID to '0'). This restriction requires a SW update to sequentially update the DATA registers followed by an update of the STATUS register.

Note: For the exceptional SW use case, sequential updates to the DATA and STATUS registers may be 'interrupted' by a HW fault capture. In this case, the SW DATA register updates are overwritten by the HW update (and the STATUS.IDX field will reflect the HW capture)</description>

SW writes a '1' to this field to clear the interrupt cause to '0'. SW clear STATUS.VALID to '0' to enable capture of the next fault.

                <description>Selects one of the 16 input triggers as a reload trigger. In QUAD mode, this is the index or revolution pulse. In this mode, it will update the counter with the value in the TCPWM_CNTn_PERIOD register.</description>

                <description>Selects one of the 16 input triggers as a stop trigger. In PWM, PWM_DT and PWM_PR modes, this is the kill trigger. In these modes, the kill trigger is used to either temporarily block the PWM outputs (PWM_STOP_ON_KILL is '0') or stop the functionality (PWM_STOP_ON_KILL is '1'). For the PWM and PWM_DT modes, the blocking of the output signals can be  asynchronous (STOP_EDGE should be NO_EDGE_DET) in which case the blocking is as long as the trigger is '1' or synchronous (STOP_EDGE should be RISING_EDGE) in which case it extends till the next terminal count event.</description>

The clocking for the rest of the logic is determined by CTRL.EC_OP_MODE.

Externally clocked mode is only used for synchronous serial interface protocols (SPI and I2C) in slave mode. In SPI mode, only Motorola submode (all Motorola modes: 0, 1, 2, 3) is supported.

'0': Internally clocked mode 
'1': externally clocked mode
 In internally clocked mode, the serial interface protocols run off the SCB clock. In externally clocked mode, the serial interface protocols run off the clock as provided by the serial interface. 

Externally clocked operation mode is only used for synchronous serial interface protocols (SPI and I2C) in slave mode AND EZ mode. In SPI mode, only Motorola submode (all Motorola modes: 0, 1, 2, 3) is supported. The maximum SPI slave, EZ mode bitrate is 48 Mbps (transmission and IO delays outside the IP will degrade the effective bitrate).

In UART mode this field should be '0'.</description>

              <description>Non EZ mode ('0') or EZ mode ('1').
In EZ mode, a meta protocol is applied to the serial interface protocol. This meta protocol adds meaning to the data frames transferred by the serial interface protocol: a data frame can represent a memory address, a write memory data element or a read memory data element. EZ mode is only used for synchronous serial interface protocols: SPI and I2C. In SPI mode, only Motorola submode (all Motorola modes: 0, 1, 2, 3) is supported and the transmitter should use continuous data frames; i.e. data frames not separated by slave deselection. This mode is only applicable to slave functionality. In EZ mode, the slave can read from and write to an addressable memory structure of 32 bytes. In EZ mode, data frames should 8-bit in size and should be transmitted and received with the Most Significant Bit (MSB) first.

In UART mode this field should be '0'.</description>

In I2C mode, this field is used to allow the slave to put the received slave address or general call address in the RX FIFO. Note that a received matching address is put in the RX FIFO when this bit is '1' for both I2C read and write transfers.

In multi-processor UART receiver mode, this field is used to allow the receiver to put the received address in the RX FIFO. Note: non-matching addresses are never put in the RX FIFO.</description>

IF BLOCK is '0' and the accesses collide, CPU read operations return 0xffff:ffff and CPU write operations are ignored. Colliding accesses are registered as interrupt causes: INTR_TX.BLOCKED and INTR_RX.BLOCKED.</description>

              <description>SCB block is enabled ('1') or not ('0'). The proper order in which to initialize SCB is as follows:
- Program protocol specific information using SPI_CTRL, UART_CTRL (and UART_TX_CTRL and UART_RX_CTRL) or I2C_CTRL registers. This includes selection of a submode, master/slave functionality and transmitter/receiver functionality when applicable.
- Program generic transmitter (TX_CTRL) and receiver (RX_CTRL) information. This includes enabling of the transmitter and receiver functionality.
- Program transmitter FIFO (TX_FIFO_CTRL) and receiver FIFO (RX_FIFO_CTRL) information.
- Program CTRL register to enable SCB, select the specific operation mode and oversampling factor.
When this block is enabled, no control information should be changed. Changes should be made AFTER disabling this block, e.g. to modify the operation mode (from I2C to SPI) or to go from externally to internally clocked. The change takes effect after the block is re-enabled. Note that disabling the block will cause re-initialization of the design and associated state is lost (e.g. FIFO content).</description>

When '1', the alternate clock edge is used (which comes half a SPI SCLK period later). Late sampling addresses the round trip delay associated with transmitting SCLK from the master to the slave and transmitting MISO from the slave to the master.</description>

              <description>Only applicable in standard UART submode. When '1', the receiver performs break detection and baud rate detection on the incoming data. First, break detection counts the amount of bit periods that have a line value of '0'. BREAK_WIDTH specifies the minimum required amount of bit periods. Successful break detection sets the INTR_RX.BREAK_DETECT interrupt cause to '1'. Second, baud rate detection counts the amount of peripheral clock periods that are use to receive the synchronization byte (0x55; least significant bit first). The count is available through UART_RX_STATUS.BR_COUNTER. Successful baud rate detection sets the INTR_RX.BAUD_DETECT interrupt cause to '1' (BR_COUNTER is reliable). This functionality is used to synchronize/refine the receiver clock to the transmitter clock. The receiver software can use the BR_COUNTER value to set the right IP clock (from the programmable clock IP) to guarantee successful receipt of the first LIN data frame (Protected Identifier Field) after the synchronization byte.</description>

The field is only used in master mode. In slave mode, the field is NOT used. However, there is a frequency requirement for the SCB clock wrt. the regular interface (IF) high time to guarantee functional correct behavior. With input signal median filtering, the IF high time should be &gt;= 6 SCB clock cycles and &lt;= 16 SCB clock cycles. Without input signal median filtering, the IF high time should be &gt;= 5 SCB clock cycles and &lt;= 16 SCB clock cycles.</description>

              <description>Serial I2C interface low phase oversampling factor. LOW_PHASE_OVS + 1 SCB clock periods constitute the low phase of a bit period. The valid range is [7, 15] with input signal median filtering and [6, 15] without input signal median filtering. 

The field is only used in master mode. In slave mode, the field is NOT used. However, there is a frequency requirement for the SCB clock wrt. the regular (no stretching) interface (IF) low time to guarantee functionally correct behavior. With input signal median filtering, the IF low time should be &gt;= 8 SCB clock cycles and &lt;= 16 IP clock cycles. Without input signal median filtering, the IF low time should be &gt;= 7 SCB clock cycles and &lt;= 16 SCB clock cycles.</description>

              <description>This field is used during an address match or general call address in internally clocked mode 
Only used when:
 - EC_AM_MODE is '0', EC_OP_MODE is '0', S_GENERAL_IGNORE is '0] and non EZ mode.
Functionality is as follows:
- 1: a received (matching) slave address is immediately NACK'd when the receiver FIFO is full.
- 0: clock stretching is performed (till the receiver FIFO is no longer full). 

For externally clocked logic (EC_AM is '1') on an address match or general call address (and S_GENERAL_IGNORE is '0'). Only used when (NOT used when EC_AM is '1' and EC_OP is '1' and address match and EZ mode):
- EC_AM is '1' and EC_OP is '0'.
- EC_AM is '1' and general call address match.
- EC_AM is '1' and non EZ mode.
Functionality is as follows:
- 1: a received (matching or general) slave address is always immediately NACK'd. There are two possibilities:
       1). the SCB clock is available (in Active system power mode) and it handles the rest of the current transfer. In this case the I2C master will not observe the NACK. 
       2).SCB clock is not present (in DeepSleep system power mode). In this case the I2C master will observe the NACK and may retry the transfer in the future (which gives the internally clocked logic the time to wake up from DeepSleep system power mode). 
- 0: clock stretching is performed (till the SCB clock is available). The logic will handle the ongoing transfer as soon as the clock is enabled.</description>

              <name>BUS_BUSY</name>
              <description>I2C bus is busy. The bus is considered busy ('1'), from the time a START is detected or from the time the SCL line is '0'. The bus is considered idle ('0'), from the time a STOP is detected. If SCB block is disabled, BUS_BUSY is '0'. After enabling the block, it takes time for the BUS_BUSY to detect a busy bus. This time is the maximum high time of the SCL line. For a 100 kHz interface frequency, this maximum high time may last roughly 5 us (half a bit period).

For single master systems, BUS_BUSY does not have to be used to detect an idle bus before a master starts a transfer using I2C_M_CMD.M_START (no bus collisions).

For multi-master systems, BUS_BUSY can be used to detect an idle bus before a master starts a transfer using I2C_M_CMD.M_START_ON_IDLE (to prevent bus collisions).</description>

              <description>When '1', transmit a START or REPEATED START. Whether a START or REPEATED START is transmitted depends on the state of the master state machine. A START is only transmitted when the master state machine is in the default state. A REPEATED START is transmitted when the master state machine is not in the default state, but is working on an ongoing transaction. The REPEATED START can only be transmitted after a NACK or ACK has been received for a transmitted data element or after a NACK has been transmitted for a received data element. When this action is performed, the hardware sets this field to '0'.</description>

For bus idle detection the hardware relies on STOP detection. As a result, bus idle detection is only functional after at least one I2C bus transfer has been detected on the bus (default/reset value of BUSY is '0') . A START is only transmitted when the master state machine is in the default state. When this action is performed, the hardware sets this field to '0'.</description>

This should not occur, it represents erroneous I2C bus behavior. In case of lost arbitration, the I2C slave state machine aborts the ongoing transfer. The Firmware may decide to clear the TX and RX FIFOs in case of this error.</description>

              <description>I2C slave START received. Set to '1', when START or REPEATED START event is detected.

In the case of externally clocked address matching (CTRL.EC_AM_MODE is '1') AND clock stretching is performed (I2C_CTRL.S_NOT_READY_ADDR_NACK is '0'), this field is NOT set. The Firmware should use INTR_S_EC.WAKE_UP, INTR_S.I2C_ADDR_MATCH and INTR_S.I2C_GENERAL.</description>

'0': 1 bit period.
'1': 2 bit periods (default value).

In UART mode, this field specifies the data field size:
'0': 5 bit data field.

'2': 7 bit data field.
'3': 8 bit data field.
When the data field size is less than 8 bits, the most significant (unused) bits of the DATAx.DATAy[7:0] fields should be set to '0' for the transmitter.</description>

                <name>BREAK_WAKEUP_LENGTH</name>
                <description>Break/wakeup length (minus 1) in bit periods:
'0': 1 bit period.
...
'10': 11 bit periods (break length for slave nodes)
...
'12': 13 bit periods (break length for master nodes)
...
'30': 31 bit periods.
'31': Illegal (should NOT be used!!!)

This field is used for transmission/reception of BOTH break and wakeup signals. Note that these functions are mutually exclusive:
- When CMD.TX_HEADER is '1', the field specifies the transmitted break field.
- When CMD.TX_WAKEUP is '1', the field specifies the transmitted wakeup field.
- When CMD.RX_HEADER is '1', the field specifies the to be received break field.
- Otherwise, the field specifies the to be received wakeup field.

Per the standard, the master wakeup duration is between 250 us and 5 ms. To support uncalibrated slaves, a slave has a detection threshold of 150 us (3 bit periods at 20 kbps). After transmission of a break or wakeup signal, the INTR.TX_BREAK_WAKEUP_DONE interrupt cause is activated. After reception of a wakeup signal, the INTR.RX_BREAK_WAKEUP_DONE interrupt cause is activated.

To specify longer wakeup signals in terms of absolute time (us/ms rather than bit periods), the associated PERI clock divider value can be (temporarily) increased to make the LIN bit period longer.

Note: entering bus sleep mode is achieved with the 'go-to-sleep' command.</description>

The header is transmitted when the PID field STOP bits are transmitted (INTR.TX_HEADER_DONE).

HW sets this field to '1', when the 'tr_cmd_tx_header' input trigger is activated. This allows for time triggered LIN message transfer. HW driven time triggered transfer eliminates the jitter that is typically associated with SW driven transfer.

In UART mode, a single data field (DATA0.DATA1) is transmitted.</description>

The header is received when the PID field STOP bits are received (INTR.RX_HEADER_DONE).

Typically, a slave node SW sets both RX_HEADER and RX_RESPONSE to '1', anticipating a transfer of a response from the master node to this slave node. After receipt of the header PID field (INTR.RX_HEADER_PID_DONE is activated), the slave node may decide to set TX_RESPONSE to '1' (which has a higher priority than RX_RESPONSE) to transmit a response.

the Break detection is performed regardless of CMD.RX_HEADER.
INTR.RX_BREAK_WAKEUP_DONE will trigger at LIN_RX rising edge, when the low pulse meet CTL0.BREAK_WAKEUP_LENGTH. when Break is detected, HW check CMD.RX_HEADER before entering SYNC byte processing state. when RX_HEADER is cleared, SW has at least 11 bit times to set RX_HEADER again, before next Break is detected (RX_BREAK_WAKEUP_DONE). in this case, there is no gap, Break will never be missed.

                <description>Synchronization counter in LIN channel clock periods. After the receipt of a synchronization field, this fields reflects the duration of the synchronization field. Ideally, SYNC_COUNTER = 8*16 = 128 (the synchronization fields consists of eight bit period of 16 LIN channel clock periods each).
- If SYNC_COUNTER is less than 128, the LIN channel clock is too slow and the PERI/PCLK divider value should be decreased.
- If SYNC_COUNTER is greater than 128, the LIN channel clock is too fast and the PERI/PCLK divider value should be increased.

The biggest master-slave clock discrepancy occurs when the master is slow and the slave is fast or vice versa. At a 0.5 percent master inaccuracy and a 14 percent slave inaccuracy, this results in the extreme synchronization values of (.86 * 128) / 1.005 = 109.5 and (1.14 *128) / 0.995 = 146.6. We add a little margin for a valid range of [106, 152].

Note: Only slave nodes with imprecise clocks require clock resynchronization. Master and slave nodes with precise clocks do NOT require clock resynchronization.</description>

If CTL.AUTO_EN is '0', SW controls this field to enable the external transceiver. If CTL.AUTO_EN is '1', HW controls this field to enable the external transceiver:
- Before a legal command sequence, HW sets this field to '1', if it is '0'. The start of the command sequence is effectively postponed by a 4-bit period preamble.
- After a legal command sequence, HW clears this field to '0'. The end of the command sequence is effectively postponed by a 4-bit period postamble.

Note: external transceivers require a 'power up' or 'power down' period of 1 or 2 bit periods, so a 4-bit period suffices for all known transceivers.</description>

                <description>Header protected identifier (PID). 
- Bits 5 down to 0: frame identifier ID[5:0].
Frame identifier 0x3c is for a 'master request' frame, 0x3d is for a 'slave response' frame, 0x3e and 0x3f are for future LIN enhancements. Frame identifier ID[5:4] is optionally used for length control; i.e. specifies the number of response data fields.
- Bits 1 down to 0: parity bits P[1] and P[0].
  - P[1] = ! (ID[5] ^ ID[4] ^ ID[3] ^ ID[1])
  - P[0] = (ID[4] ^ ID[2] ^ ID[1] ^ ID[0])

Transmission: To be transmitted PID field. SW needs to calculate the PID field parity bits P[1] and P[0].

Reception: Received PID field. Slave node SW uses the PID field to determine how to handle the response for a received frame header: TX_RESPONSE or  RX_RESPONSE.</description>

Transmission: HW calculated checksum (SW does not need to calculate the checksum) over the transmitted PID field (optional per CTL.CHECKSUM_ENHANCED) and data fields.

Reception: Received checksum. Note that in case of a RX_CHECKSUM_ERROR, SW can use the received PID field and the  received data fields to calculate the correct checksum value.</description>

                <description>Secondary Channel Enable

Use case is for diagnostic or temperature measurements. When a digital channel is set as secondary, when it is triggered, by a secondary trigger, the conversion of the channel pends until the next primary conversion completes. Secondary channels should always have a higher dchan index than the enabled primary channels associated with the same analog channel (ACHAN).  For example if both dchan0 and dchan1 are  using achan0, then dchan0 should never be set as a secondary channel.
 
0 - digital channel is configured as primary channel 
1 - digital channel is configured as secondary channel</description>

VREF_BUF_EN should only be used when a reference other than the default reference (HPBGR 0.1 percent reference) is used.  When the HPBGR reference is used, the reference is provided directly from the HPBGR with the help from external cap for the transients.

If this bit is set on a secondary channel, vref_buf_en for the assigned analog channel will be set once the secondary channel is pended to allow enough ramp up time of the VREFH buffer so that it is ready to sample once the secondary channel is ready to convert. The required ramp-up time of the VREFH buffer is 6 us, it is on the user to ensure the secondary channel is pended early enough to ensure this ramp-up time if the associated primary channel does not have this bit set.</description>

This bit controls the offset correction feature of the Decimator filter.  The offset value is programmed in the OCOR bits of the OFST_COR register. Conversion results are unpredictable if this bit is changed while the filter is running.

This must be set to use DCHAN.OFST_COR or GAIN_LVL_STRUCT.OFST_COR, which one it chooses is based on DCHAN_CTL.AGC_GAIN_EN.

If OCOR_EN and GCOR_EN are both disabled this prevents the capability to loop back the data valid HW trigger of this channel and use it as the conversion start HW trigger of this channel. If either GCOR or OCOR is enabled this is allowed.</description>

This bit controls the gain correction feature of the Decimator filter. The gain coefficient is programmed in the GCOR bits of the GAIN_COR register. Which bits in this 16-bit field that are valid is set in GVAL. Conversion results are unpredictable if this bit is changed while the filter is running. When this feature is enabled, the DR register field must be set to a value higher than 32 (worst case) for proper operation. See the DR register definition of cases where values less than 32 are allowed.

This must be set to use DCHAN.GAIN_COR or GAIN_LVL_STRUCT.GAIN_COR.  
The value chosen, is based on DCHAN_CTL.AGC_GAIN_EN

If OCOR_EN and GCOR_EN are both disabled this prevents the capability to loop back the data valid HW trigger of this channel and use it as the conversion start HW trigger of this channel. If either GCOR or OCOR is enabled this is allowed.</description>

                <description>Decimation Ratio

DR is an 7-bit field that sets the decimation ratio (DR+1) in the  sinc3/sinc4 CIC filter.  The decimation ratio minus one is the value that is programmed into this register.

Changing this field during a conversion will disrupt the output value. Conversion results are unpredictable if these bits are changed while the filter is running.

The suggested minimum value of DR is 0x3F. 
If a lower value is required, the minimum DR is determined by GVAL if gain is enabled.

DR &gt; (GCOR_COR.GVAL) * 2 when GCOR_EN is set to 1.

An example of some acceptable values for DR/DR2:

                <description>Saturation Enable

Controls saturation logic in the Decimator. When enabled, gain and offset calculations are held to the most positive or negative values, rather then wrapping around. Conversion results are unpredictable if this bit is changed while during a conversion. This bit is ignored if OCOR_EN and GCOR_EN are all 0. This feature is used to prevent wrap-around if the decimator is incorrectly configured. This bit should be set to 1 if OCOR_EN or GCOR_EN is set to 1.</description>

                <description>Decimation Ratio 2 

DR2 is a 5-bit field that sets the decimation ratio (DR2+1) of the sinc2 rate reducer within the Decimator. The decimation ratio of the rate reducer minus one is the value that is programmed into this register. This field should not be changed during a conversion.

DR2 must be less than DR/2.

Value for left shift amount of modulator input data. Supported values are 0 - 9. Using values 10-15 may result in a loss of data

This register provides control information to the input (left) shifter. SHIFTL is a 4-bit field that sets the amount of left shift that the Modulator input will be shifted. Disturbing this field during a conversion will disturb the output value. This register should only be updated while the CIC filter is in the Standby state. Conversion results are unpredictable if these bits are changed while the filter is running. A read of this register produces the last value written to this register.

This value is overridden by the Gain Level setting when DCHAN_CTL.AGC_GAIN_EN=1</description>

Value for the amount of right shift for the input of the post processor (output of the FIR filter). The right shift operation is the first Post Processor operation. Processor. Functional values range from 0 to 15, 0 = no shift. This shift value will be based on the values of the FIR coefficients and the number of FIR taps. If the FIR is disabled, this value can be 0.

If the FIR is enabled this shift value can be calculated by using the following:

datapath bandwith:
dp_bw =  log2(qlev) + max(SHIFTL) + N*log2(DR +1)  +2*log2(DR2+1) - DEC_SHIFTR - RR_SHIFTR

FIR datapath adjustment:

                <description>Number of valid bits minus one in Gain Coefficient registers GCOR

GVAL is a 4-bit field that signifies to the HW how many bits of GCOR field are valid. The number of valid bits minus one should be written (0000b = 1 bit, 1111b = all 16 bits). Updates to this register will be ignored until the start of the next multiply. This register may be written while the filter is running. The valid field is measured from LSB (bit 0) up. Note that the HW always assumes the field specified by GVAL is left justified (starts at bit 0 of GCOR) and has a binary-point after the left-most digit. For example, if GVAL is programmed with a 7d, this means there are 8 valid bits in GCOR and they have the format x.xxxxxxxb. If GCOR holds the value 00000000 10100000b and GVAL is 7, only the low-order 8 bits are considered (10100000b) and the binary point is assumed after the left-most digit (1.0100000b). The multiply coefficient in the example would be 1.25d. Although a good explanation example, this isn't the most efficient way to multiply by 1.25d. Better would be GCOR holds the value 00000000 00000101b and GVAL is 2, which gives (1.01b). Another example: If it is desired to multiply by a gain coefficient of 0.125d (0.001b) then GCOR would be programmed with a value of 00000001b, GCORH with 00000000b and GVAL (GVAL) with 0011b - meaning there are 4 valid bits x.xxxb. The multiplier thus has a coefficient range of 1/(2^15) to 2.0-(1/(2^15)) in steps of 1/(2^15)</description>

Once the ACC_RESULT register surpasses the threshold value written to this register the ACC_RESULT the ACC_THRESH_INTR is set. This value is signed and follows the two's-complement notation. 

If ACC_THRESH is set to a positive value, the ACC_RESULT must surpass the positive value of the ACC_THRESH to set the ACC_THRESH_INTR.

If ACC_THRESH is set to a negative value, the ACC_RESULT must surpass the negative value ( a greater magnitude) of the ACC_THRESH to set the ACC_THRESH_INTR.</description>

This field can be used as a sequence ID, this field increments for every valid sample For example if moving average is enabled and set to 4. SMP_COUNT will equal one on the fourth sample, which will be the first data valid (interrupt). If moving average is disabled, the first sample will be valid. This value is set simultaneously with the result data. The count value is reset with PACSS_MMIO.PACSS_CTL.ENABLE=0 or DCHAN.DCHAN_CTL.ENABLE=0.</description>

The coefficient values can range from -1+1/(2^15) to 1-1/(2^15) with a resolution of 1/(2^15). The coefficient uses twos-complement notation and the decimal point is fixed to the right of the most significant bit.

Examples: -0.25 = 0xE000 and 0.25 = 0x2000

Note: The Coefficient values are stored in SRAM, not registers. They are not initialized during a reset.  They also cannot be accessed during a conversion.</description>

Buffer cross chopping is on the input and  output of the buffer using the modbit. This mode toggles the modbit when the SMP_CNT value is reached.

Buffer cross chopping is only functional in the configurations where ACHAN0 is only mapped to DCHAN0, or ACHAN1 (if present) is only mapped to DCHAN1 (if present).</description>

The negative pump requires a 24 MHz clock

For bit decode use the following:

00: pump clock sourced by clk_pump/2, use if clk_pump is set to 48MHz
01: pump clock sourced by clk_pump/1, use if clk_pump is set to 24 MHz
10: pump clock sourced by clk_hf/2, use if clk_hf is set to 48 MHz
11: pump clock sourced by clk_hf/1, use if clk_hf is set to 24 MHz</description>

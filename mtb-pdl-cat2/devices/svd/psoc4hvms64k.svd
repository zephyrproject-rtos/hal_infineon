              <name>ENABLE</name>
              <description>Clock divider enable command (mutually exclusive with DISABLE). Typically, SW sets this field to '1' to enable a divider and HW sets this field to '0' to indicate that divider enabling has completed. When a divider is enabled, its integer and fractional (if present) counters are initialized to '0'. If a divider is to be re-enabled using different integer and fractional divider values, the SW should follow these steps:
0: Disable the divider using the DIV_CMD.DISABLE field.
1: Configure the divider's DIV_XXX_CTL register.
2: Enable the divider using the DIV_CMD_ENABLE field.
 
The SEL_DIV and SEL_TYPE fields specify which divider is to be enabled. The enabled divider may be phase aligned to either 'clk_hf' (typical usage) or to ANY enabled divider.
 
The PA_SEL_DIV and P_SEL_TYPE fields specify the reference divider.
 
The HW sets the ENABLE field to '0' when the enabling is performed and the HW sets the DIV_XXX_CTL.EN field of the divider to '1' when the enabling is performed. Note that enabling with phase alignment to a low frequency divider takes time. E.g. To align to a divider that generates a clock of 'clk_hf'/n (with n being the integer divider value INT_DIV+1), up to n cycles may be required to perform alignment. Phase alignment to 'clk_hf' takes affect immediately. SW can set this field to '0' during phase alignment to abort the enabling process.</description>

If SEL_DIV is '63' and 'SEL_TYPE' is '3' (default/reset value), no divider is specified and no clock control signal(s) are generated.
 
When transitioning a clock between two out of phase dividers, spurious clock control signals may be generated for one 'clk_hf' cycle during this transition. These clock control signals may cause a single clock period that is smaller than any of the two divider periods. To prevent these spurious clock signals, the clock multiplexer can be disconnected (SEL_DIV is '63' and 'SEL_TYPE' is '3') for a transition time that is larger than the smaller of the two divider periods.</description>

                <description>Specifies input trigger. This field is typically set during the setup of a chip use case scenario. Changing this field while activated triggers are present on the input triggers may result in unpredictable behavior. Note that input trigger 0 (default value) is typically connected to a constant signal level of '0', and as a result will not cause HW activation of the output trigger.</description>

Counting starts internally when this register is written with a nonzero value.  CAL_COUNTER_DONE goes immediately low to indicate that the counter has started and will be asserted when the counters are done.  Do not write this field unless CAL_COUNTER_DONE==1.  Both clocks must be running or the measurement will not complete.  A stalled counter can be recovered by selecting valid clocks, waiting until the measurement completes, and discarding the first result.  CAL_COUNTER1 should always be &gt; 1.  Due to internal clock synchronization CAL_COUNTER1 should be at least 5 times the 1/F_cnt2.</description>

              <description>Pauses/runs this counter while a debugger is connected.  Other behaviors are unchanged during debugging, including service, configuration updates and enable/disable.  Note it may take up to two clk_lf cycles for the counter to pause and another two cycles to unpause, due to internal synchronization.  If the debugger is connected for at least two clk_lf cycles, the EARLY_ACTION is ignored until after the first service after the debugger is disconnected.  This prevents an unintentional trigger of the EARLY_ACTION before the firmware realigns the servicing period.  After the first service, EARLY_ACTION behaves as configured.  If the debugger is disconnected before two clk_lf cycles, the EARLY_ACTION may or may not be ignored.
0: When debugger connected, counter pauses incrementing.
1: When debugger connected, counter increments normally, but reset generation is blocked.

To pause at a breakpoint while debugging, configure the trigger matrix to connect the related CPU halted signal to the trigger input for this WDT, and then set this bit.  It takes up to two clk_lf cycles for the trigger signal to be processed.  Triggers that are less than two clk_lf cycles may be missed.  Synchronization error can accumulate each time it is halted.

During DeepSleep wakeup, the pause request is removed when clk_hf starts clocking, and then it may take up to two clk_lf cycles for the counter to start.  After wakeup, the LOWER_ACTION is ignored until after the first service.  This prevents an unintentional trigger of the LOWER_ACTION before the firmware realigns the servicing period.  After the first service, LOWER_ACTION behaves as configured.
0: Counter behaves normally during DeepSleep.

Note it may take up to two clk_lf cycles for the counter to pause and another two cycles to unpause, due to internal synchronization.  If the debugger is connected for at least two clk_lf cycles, the LOWER_ACTION is ignored until after the first service after the debugger is disconnected.  This prevents an unintentional trigger of the LOWER_ACTION before the firmware realigns the servicing period.  After the first service, LOWER_ACTION behaves as configured.  If the debugger is disconnected before two clk_lf cycles, the LOWER_ACTION may or may not be ignored.
0: When debugger connected, counter pauses incrementing as configured in DEBUG_TRIGGER_EN.
1: When debugger connected, counter increments normally, but reset generation is blocked.</description>

              <description>PILO enable.  Setting this bit will enable the PILO and clearing this bit will disable it.  Do not disable this clock prior to changing  CLK_LF to use the PILO as a source.  CLK_LF must be configured to use PILO as a source while the PILO clock is enabled prior to making such a change.   Writes to this field are ignored when LFCLK_SEL is using this clock as the source and WDT is locked using WDT_LOCK register.  Consequently, if CLK_LF is sourced by the PILO and the PILO is to be disabled, clear WDT_LOCK before-hand. This register field resets with hard reset (power related, XRES, WDT).</description>

              <description>Each IO port has an associated bit field in this register. The bit field reflects the IO port's interrupt line (bit field i reflects 'interrupts_gpio[i]' for IO port i). The register is used when the system uses a shared/combined interrupt line 'interrupt_gpio'. The SW ISR reads the register to determine which IO port(s) is responsible for the shared/combined interrupt line 'interrupt_gpio'. Once, the IO port(s) is determined, the IO port's INTR register is read to determine the IO pad(s) in the IO port that caused the interrupt.</description>

'20'-'30': Clock source is constant '0'. Any of these clock sources should be selected when the IP is disabled to ensure low power consumption.
'31': clk_sys/'1'. This selection is NOT intended for 'clk_sys' operation, but for asynchronous operation: three 'clk_sys' cycles after enabling the IP, the IP is fully functional (reset is de-activated). To be used for asynchronous (clockless) fabric functionality.</description>

                <description>IO cell hold override functionality. In DeepSleep and Hibernate power modes, the HSIOM holds the IO cell output and output enable signals if Active functionality is connected to the IO pads. This is undesirable if the PRGIO is supposed to deliver DeepSleep or Hibernate output functionality on these IO pads. This field is used to control the hold override functionality from the PRGIO:
'0': The HSIOM controls the IO cell hold override functionality ('hsiom_hld_ovr').
'1': The PRGIO controls the IO cel hold override functionality:
- In bypass mode (ENABLED is '0' or BYPASS[i] is '1'), the HSIOM control is used.
- In NON bypass mode (ENABLED is '1' and BYPASS[i] is '0'), the PRGIO sets hold override to 'pwr_hld_ovr_hib' to enable PRGIO functionality in DeepSleep and Hibernate power modes (but disables it in Stop power mode).

Note that in Hibernate power mode, the PRGIO should not rely on the state of Active or DeepSleep functionality signals from the HSIOM: these signals are clamped to '0' in Hibernate'</description>

'0': Disabled (signals are bypassed; behavior as if BYPASS is 0xFF). When disabled, the fabric (data unit and LUTs) reset is activated.

If the IP is disabled:
- The PIPELINE_EN register field should be set to '1', to ensure low power consumption by preventing combinatorial loops.
- The CLOCK_SRC register field should be set to '20'-'30' (clock is constant '0'), to ensure low power consumption.

'1': Enabled. Once enabled, it takes 3 'clk_fabric' clock cycles till the fabric reset is de-activated and the fabric becomes fully functional. This ensures that the IO pins' input synchronizer states are flushed when the fabric is fully functional.</description>

This field is used as the AHB-Lite hprot[1] signal to implement Infineon proprietary user/privileged modes. These modes are used to enable/disable access to specific MMIO registers and memory regions.</description>

'0': CPU write access.
'1': DAP write access.

For a SW write to the SYSREQ register, the HW will update this field based on the value of SYSCALL_REQ.

SYSCALL_REQ = 0 : the current source of write access is captured.
SYSCALL_REQ = 1 : the previous value (captured when SYSCALL_REQ was 0), is retained/maintained until the next SW write to this register.</description>

              <description>CPU/DAP writes a '1' to this field to request a SystemCall. The HMASTER_0 field indicates the source of the write access. Setting this field to '1' immediate results in a NMI. The SystemCall NMI interrupt handler sets this field to '0' after servicing the request.</description>

              <description>0': IP is disabled. Non-retainable MMIO registers and logic functionality are reset (retainable MMIO registers are NOT reset):
- INTR register is set to '0'.
- DW/DMA functionality is aborted.
- DW/DMA controller input/pending triggers are de-activated.
- DW/DMA controller output triggers are de-activated.
Disabling the IP has the same effect as an active 'rst_sys_act_n' reset in DeepSleep power mode. To prevent a loss of active (pending) DW/DMA triggers when disabling the IP or when transitioning from Active to DeepSleep power mode, the STATUS.ACTIVE and STATUS_CH_ACT.CH fields can be used.

Note that most MMIO registers are retainable, and a transition from DeepSleep to Active/Sleep power modes makes the DW/DMA controller operational, and ready to react to DW/DMA input triggers that are activated after the transition. Triggers are Active/Sleep functionality.
'1': IP is enabled.</description>

                <description>Specifies whether the data transfer engine should wait for the channel to be deactivated; i.e. the selected system trigger is not active. This field is used to synchronize the controller's data transfer(s) with the agent that generated the trigger. This field is ONLY used at the completion of an opcode. E.g., a FIFO indicates that it is empty and it needs a new data sample. The agent removes the trigger ONLY when the data sample has been written by the transfer engine AND received by the agent.  Furthermore, the agent's trigger may be delayed by a few cycles before it reaches the DW/DMA controller. This field is used for level sensitive trigger, which reflect state (pulse sensitive triggers should have this field set to '0'). The wait cycles incurred by this field reduce DW/DMA controller performance.
'0': Do not wait for de-activation (for pulse sensitive triggers).
'1': Wait for up to 4 cycles.
'2': Wait for up to 8 cycles.
'3': Wait indefinitely. This option may result in DW/DMA controller lockup if the system trigger is not de-activated by the source agent.</description>

This field allows higher priority activated channels to preempt the current transfer in between these atomic (load, store) sequences. Preemption will NOT deactivate the current channel. As a result, after completion of a higher priority activated channel, the current channel is rescheduled.</description>

                <name>OPCODE</name>
                <description>Specifies the specific data transfer (only when the VALID bit of the descriptor's STATUS word is '1'):

'0': A single trigger initiates a single data element transfer (DW mode). This opcode specifies a transfer of a single data element. The current descriptor is completed when the amount of transferred single data elements equals the programmed buffer size (DATA_NR+1).

'1': A single trigger initiates a single descriptor transfer (DMA mode). This opcode specifies a transfer of DATA_NR+1 data elements as specified by the current descriptor structure. The current descriptor is completed when its data transfer is completed.

'2': A single trigger initiates a descriptor list transfer (DMA mode). This opcode specifies a transfer of DATA_NR+1 data elements as specified by the current descriptor structure and by successive valid descriptors. The current descriptor is completed when its data transfer is completed. This OPCODE relies on FLIPPING to be set to '1', such that the CH_CTLi.PING_PONG field is flipped/inverted and the successive descriptor is used. This continues for as long as the successive descriptor is valid. Note that as the HW is using the PING/PONG descriptor, the SW can prepare the alternate PONG/PING descriptor. The interrupt mechanism is used by HW to convey to the SW that the current descriptor is completed (and can be prepared for a successive transfer).

After completion of the opcode (and waiting for de-activation, the channel's output trigger is activated).</description>

                <description>Specifies the index of the current data transfer. This value increases from 0 to CONTROL.DATA_NR. HW sets this field:
- When a descriptor is done (RESPONSE is DONE), the field is set to '0' when PING_CTL.INV_DESCR is '0' and the field is set to PING_CTL.DATA_NR when PING_CTL.INV_DESCR is '1'.
- When a descriptor is not done (RESPONSE is NO_ERROR), the field reflects the progress of a data transfer.
- In case of erroneous behavior (RESPONSE is neither DONE or NO_ERROR), the field is not updated, but keeps its value to ease debugging.
HW only modifies this field for an active descriptor (STATUS.VALID to be '1'). At descriptor initialization, SW should set this field to '0'. 

This field allows software to read the progress of the data transfer. Note that SRC.ADDR and DST.ADDR represent base addresses and are not modified during data transfer. However, STATUS.CURR_DATA_NR is modified during data transfer and provides an offset wrt. the base addresses.</description>

                <description>Response code (the first two codes NO_ERROR and DONE are the result of normal behavior, the other codes are the result of erroneous behavior).
'0'/NO_ERROR: No error. Setting this response does NOT set the interrupt cause bit to '1'. STATUS.VALID is NOT affected. CH_CTLi.ENABLED is NOT affected. CH_CTLi.PING_PONG is not updated. This response is used for an unused or not completed descriptor. Software should set the RESPONSE field to '0'/NO_ERROR during descriptor initialization.
'1'/DONE: Descriptor is done (without errors). Setting this response sets the interrupt cause bit to '1' if CONTROL.SET_CAUSE is '1'. STATUS.VALID is set to '0' if CONTROL.INV_DESCR is '1'. CH_CTLi.ENABLED is NOT affected. CH_CTLi.PING_PONG is updated if CONTROL.FLIPPING is '1'.
'2'/SRC_BUS_ERROR: Bus error while loading data from the source location. Setting this response sets the interrupt cause bit to '1'. STATUS.VALID is set '0'. CH_CTLi.ENABLED is set to '0'. CH_CTLi.PING_PONG is not updated (it identifies the descriptor that caused the error).
'3'/DST_BUS_ERROR: Bus error while storing data to the destination location. Setting this response sets the interrupt cause bit to '1'. STATUS.VALID is set '0'. CH_CTLi.ENABLED is set to '0'. CH_CTLi.PING_PONG is not updated (it identifies the descriptor that caused the error).
'4'/SRC_MISAL: Misalignment of source address. This occurs on a 16-bit bus transfer that is not 2-byte aligned or on a 32-bit bus transfer that is not 4-byte aligned. Setting this response sets the interrupt cause bit to '1'. STATUS.VALID is set '0'. CH_CTLi.ENABLED is set to '0'. CH_CTLi.PING_PONG is not updated (it identifies the descriptor that caused the error).
'5'/DST_MISAL: Misalignment of destination address. This occurs on a 16-bit bus transfer that is not 2-byte aligned or on a 32-bit bus transfer that is not 4-byte aligned. Setting this response sets the interrupt cause bit to '1'. STATUS.VALID is set '0'. CH_CTLi.ENABLED is set to '0'. CH_CTLi.PING_PONG is not updated (it identifies the descriptor that caused the error).
'6'/INVALID_DESCR: Invalid descriptor (STATUS.VALID is '0'). This occurs when an activated channel has an invalid descriptor. CH_CTLi.ENABLED is set to '0'. CH_CTLi.PING_PONG is not updated (it identifies the descriptor that caused the error).</description>

The page size is used to determine the number of Bytes in a page for Flash page based operations (e.g. PGM_PAGE).

Note: the field name FLASH_ROW is misleading, as this field specifies the number of Bytes in a page, rather than the number of Bytes in a row. In a single plane flash macro architecture, a page consists of a single row. However, in a multi plane flash macro architecture, a page consists of multiple rows from different planes.</description>

                <description>Valid indication:
'0': Invalid.
'1': Valid. STATUS.IDX, DATA0, ..., DATA1 specify the fault.

Note: Typically, HW sets this field to '1' (on an activated HW fault source that is 'enabled' by the MASK registers) and SW clears this field to '0' (typically by boot code SW (after a warm system reset, when the fault is handled). In this typical use case scenario, the HW source fault data is simultaneously captured into DATA0, ..., DATA1 when the VALID field is set to '1'. 

An exceptional SW use case scenario is identified as well. In this scenario, SW sets this field to '1' with a fault source index different to one of the defined HW fault sources. SW update is not restricted by the MASK registers). In both use case scenarios, the following holds:
- STATUS.IDX, DATA0, ..., DATA1 can only be written when STATUS.VALID is '0'; the fault structure is not in use yet. Writing STATUS.VALID to '1' effectively locks the fault structure (until SW clears STATUS.VALID to '0'). This restriction requires a SW update to sequentially update the DATA registers followed by an update of the STATUS register.

Note: For the exceptional SW use case, sequential updates to the DATA and STATUS registers may be 'interrupted' by a HW fault capture. In this case, the SW DATA register updates are overwritten by the HW update (and the STATUS.IDX field will reflect the HW capture)</description>

- STATUS.VALID is set to '1'.
- STATUS.IDX specifies the fault source index.
- DATA0 through DATA1 captures the fault source data.

SW writes a '1' to this field to clear the interrupt cause to '0'. SW clear STATUS.VALID to '0' to enable capture of the next fault. Note that when there is an enabled pending fault source, the pending fault source is captured immediately and INTR.FAULT is immediately activated (set to '1').</description>

- the associated counter triggers in the CMD register are set to '0'.
- the counter's interrupt cause fields in counter's INTR register.
- the counter's status fields in counter's STATUS register..
- the counter's trigger outputs ('tr_overflow', 'tr_underflow' and 'tr_compare_match').
- the counter's line outputs ('line_out' and 'line_compl_out').</description>

In these modes, the kill trigger is used to either temporarily block the PWM outputs (PWM_STOP_ON_KILL is '0') or stop the functionality (PWM_STOP_ON_KILL is '1'). For the PWM and PWM_DT modes, the blocking of the output signals can be  asynchronous (STOP_EDGE should be NO_EDGE_DET) in which case the blocking is as long as the trigger is '1' or synchronous (STOP_EDGE should be RISING_EDGE) in which case it extends till the next terminal count event.</description>

The clocking for the rest of the logic is determined by CTRL.EC_OP_MODE.

Externally clocked mode is only used for synchronous serial interface protocols (SPI and I2C) in slave mode. In SPI mode, only Motorola submode (all Motorola modes: 0, 1, 2, 3) is supported.

              <description>This field specifies the clocking for the SCB block
'0': Internally clocked mode 
'1': externally clocked mode
 In internally clocked mode, the serial interface protocols run off the SCB clock. In externally clocked mode, the serial interface protocols run off the clock as provided by the serial interface. 

Externally clocked operation mode is only used for synchronous serial interface protocols (SPI and I2C) in slave mode AND EZ mode. In SPI mode, only Motorola submode (all Motorola modes: 0, 1, 2, 3) is supported. The maximum SPI slave, EZ mode bitrate is 48 Mbps (transmission and IO delays outside the IP will degrade the effective bitrate).

In UART mode this field should be '0'.</description>

              <description>Non EZ mode ('0') or EZ mode ('1').
In EZ mode, a meta protocol is applied to the serial interface protocol. This meta protocol adds meaning to the data frames transferred by the serial interface protocol: a data frame can represent a memory address, a write memory data element or a read memory data element. EZ mode is only used for synchronous serial interface protocols: SPI and I2C. In SPI mode, only Motorola submode (all Motorola modes: 0, 1, 2, 3) is supported and the transmitter should use continuous data frames; i.e. data frames not separated by slave deselection. This mode is only applicable to slave functionality. In EZ mode, the slave can read from and write to an addressable memory structure of 32 bytes. In EZ mode, data frames should 8-bit in size and should be transmitted and received with the Most Significant Bit (MSB) first.

In UART mode this field should be '0'.</description>

In I2C mode, this field is used to allow the slave to put the received slave address or general call address in the RX FIFO. Note that a received matching address is put in the RX FIFO when this bit is '1' for both I2C read and write transfers.

In multi-processor UART receiver mode, this field is used to allow the receiver to put the received address in the RX FIFO. Note: non-matching addresses are never put in the RX FIFO.</description>

If the externally clocked logic and the internal CPU accesses to EZ memory coincide/collide, this bit determines whether the CPU access should block and result in bus wait states ('BLOCK is 1') or not (BLOCK is '0'). IF BLOCK is '0' and the accesses collide, CPU read operations return 0xffff:ffff and CPU write operations are ignored. Colliding accesses are registered as interrupt causes: INTR_TX.BLOCKED and INTR_RX.BLOCKED.</description>

- Program generic transmitter (TX_CTRL) and receiver (RX_CTRL) information. This includes enabling of the transmitter and receiver functionality.
- Program transmitter FIFO (TX_FIFO_CTRL) and receiver FIFO (RX_FIFO_CTRL) information.
- Program CTRL register to enable SCB, select the specific operation mode and oversampling factor.
When this block is enabled, no control information should be changed. Changes should be made AFTER disabling this block, e.g. to modify the operation mode (from I2C to SPI) or to go from externally to internally clocked. The change takes effect after the block is re-enabled. Note that disabling the block will cause re-initialization of the design and associated state is lost (e.g. FIFO content).</description>

When continuous transfers are enabled individual data frame transfers are not necessarily separated by slave deselection (as indicated by the level or pulse on the SELECT line): if the TX FIFO has multiple data frames, data frames are send out without slave deselection.

When continuous transfers are not enabled individual data frame transfers are always separated by slave deselection: independent of the availability of TX FIFO data frames, data frames are sent out with slave deselection.</description>

When '0', the default applies (

for National Semiconductors on the rising edge of SCLK). 

When '1', the alternate clock edge is used (which comes half a SPI SCLK period later). Late sampling addresses the round trip delay associated with transmitting SCLK from the master to the slave and transmitting MISO from the slave to the master.</description>

              <description>Only applicable in standard UART submode. When '1', the receiver performs break detection and baud rate detection on the incoming data. First, break detection counts the amount of bit periods that have a line value of '0'. BREAK_WIDTH specifies the minimum required amount of bit periods. Successful break detection sets the INTR_RX.BREAK_DETECT interrupt cause to '1'. Second, baud rate detection counts the amount of peripheral clock periods that are use to receive the synchronization byte (0x55; least significant bit first). The count is available through UART_RX_STATUS.BR_COUNTER. Successful baud rate detection sets the INTR_RX.BAUD_DETECT interrupt cause to '1' (BR_COUNTER is reliable). This functionality is used to synchronize/refine the receiver clock to the transmitter clock. The receiver software can use the BR_COUNTER value to set the right IP clock (from the programmable clock IP) to guarantee successful receipt of the first LIN data frame (Protected Identifier Field) after the synchronization byte.</description>

              <description>This field is used during an address match or general call address in internally clocked mode 
Only used when:
 - EC_AM_MODE is '0', EC_OP_MODE is '0', S_GENERAL_IGNORE is '0] and non EZ mode.
Functionality is as follows:
- 1: a received (matching) slave address is immediately NACK'd when the receiver FIFO is full.
- 0: clock stretching is performed (till the receiver FIFO is no longer full). 

For externally clocked logic (EC_AM is '1') on an address match or general call address (and S_GENERAL_IGNORE is '0'). Only used when (NOT used when EC_AM is '1' and EC_OP is '1' and address match and EZ mode):
- EC_AM is '1' and EC_OP is '0'.
- EC_AM is '1' and general call address match.
- EC_AM is '1' and non EZ mode.
Functionality is as follows:
- 1: a received (matching or general) slave address is always immediately NACK'd. There are two possibilities:
       1). the SCB clock is available (in Active system power mode) and it handles the rest of the current transfer. In this case the I2C master will not observe the NACK. 
       2).SCB clock is not present (in DeepSleep system power mode). In this case the I2C master will observe the NACK and may retry the transfer in the future (which gives the internally clocked logic the time to wake up from DeepSleep system power mode). 
- 0: clock stretching is performed (till the SCB clock is available). The logic will handle the ongoing transfer as soon as the clock is enabled.</description>

              <name>BUS_BUSY</name>
              <description>I2C bus is busy. The bus is considered busy ('1'), from the time a START is detected or from the time the SCL line is '0'. The bus is considered idle ('0'), from the time a STOP is detected. If SCB block is disabled, BUS_BUSY is '0'. After enabling the block, it takes time for the BUS_BUSY to detect a busy bus. This time is the maximum high time of the SCL line. For a 100 kHz interface frequency, this maximum high time may last roughly 5 us (half a bit period).

For single master systems, BUS_BUSY does not have to be used to detect an idle bus before a master starts a transfer using I2C_M_CMD.M_START (no bus collisions).

For multi-master systems, BUS_BUSY can be used to detect an idle bus before a master starts a transfer using I2C_M_CMD.M_START_ON_IDLE (to prevent bus collisions).</description>

A START is only transmitted when the master state machine is in the default state. A REPEATED START is transmitted when the master state machine is not in the default state, but is working on an ongoing transaction. The REPEATED START can only be transmitted after a NACK or ACK has been received for a transmitted data element or after a NACK has been transmitted for a received data element. When this action is performed, the hardware sets this field to '0'.</description>

For bus idle detection the hardware relies on STOP detection. As a result, bus idle detection is only functional after at least one I2C bus transfer has been detected on the bus (default/reset value of BUSY is '0') . A START is only transmitted when the master state machine is in the default state. When this action is performed, the hardware sets this field to '0'.</description>

              <description>Data read from the receiver FIFO. Reading a data frame will remove the data frame from the FIFO; i.e. behavior is similar to that of a POP operation. Note that when CTRL.BYTE_MODE is '1', only DATA[7:0] are used.

A read from an empty RX FIFO sets INTR_RX.UNDERFLOW to '1'.

When this register is read through the debugger, the data frame will not be removed from the FIFO. Similar in operation to RX_FIFO_RD_SILENT</description>

              <description>I2C slave lost arbitration: the value driven on the SDA line is not the same as the value observed on the SDA line (while the SCL line is '1'). This should not occur, it represents erroneous I2C bus behavior. In case of lost arbitration, the I2C slave state machine aborts the ongoing transfer. The Firmware may decide to clear the TX and RX FIFOs in case of this error.</description>

The number of conversions (or chop phases) for a given scan is controlled by NUM_CONV. Although only discrete values are possible for NUM_CONV, any conversion index up to this number may be selected up to NUM_CONV. For example if NUM_CONV = 7 (number of conversions is 8), then DEBUG_CONG_PH_SEL can be any value between 0 and 7 to select the particular conversion that the count is required for.</description>

              <name>NUM_PRO_OFFSET_CYCLES</name>
              <description>Maximum number of clk_mod cycles to be assigned for the PRO_OFFSET state. If NUM_PRO_OFFSET_TRIPS are observed before this timeout, exit at that point.

Programming combinations:
a) OFFSET_CYCLES == 0 &amp;&amp; OFFSET_TRIPS == 0 -&gt; Skip PRO_OFFSET
b) OFFSET_CYCLES == 0 &amp;&amp; OFFSET_TRIPS &gt; 0 -&gt; wait in PRO_OFFSET for OFFSET_TRIPS
c) OFFSET_CYCLES &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; OFFSET_TRIPS == 0 -&gt; wait in PRO_OFFSET for OFFSET_CYCLES
d) OFFSET_CYCLES &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; OFFSET_TRIPS &gt; 0 -&gt; wait in PRO_OFFSET for the first of OFFSET_CYCLES and OFFSET_TRIPS.

Note that if OFFSET_TRIPS &gt; 0:
i) SW_COTCA and SW_COCB autonomously adjust as per their description after each comparator trip apart from the last trip. Expect OFFSET_TRIPS-1 adjustments in PRO_OFFSET.
ii) If FINE_MODE == COMPENSATION SW_CFTCA and SW_CFTCB autonomously swap settings after each comparator trip apart from the last trip. Expect OFFSET_TRIPS-1 adjustments in PRO_OFFSET.
iii) For both sets of switches above, after the last trip the switches revert to their programmed MMIO setting when exiting PRO_OFFSET.

If OFFSET_TRIPS == 0 and OFFSET_CYCLES &gt; 0:
Intention is that PRO_OFFSET be a fixed duration. The autonomous behaviour for this case is the same as the OFFSET_TRIPS &gt; 0 case, except that the number of trips (and hence the number of adjustments for (i) and (ii) above) are unknown in advance. At the end of OFFSET_CYCLES, the switches revert to their programmed MMIO setting when exiting PRO_OFFSET.</description>

Note that a 'trip' is defined as a change of state of the comparator (either a 0 to 1 or a 1 to 0 transition). A trip at the very start of PRO_OFFSET is considered a trip with respect to this count.</description>

              <description>CMOD1 enable.

Firmware Rule:
1) If any of C1CA/C1CB/C1CC can be 1 (statically or dynamically), ENABLED must be 1.
2) If statically closing (using CLOSED setting) any of C1CA/C1CB/C2CC, ENABLE must be set to 1 in a previous bus access to ensure break-before-make. When re-opening from static CLOSED, C1CA/C1CB/C1CC must be opened in a previous bus access before clearing ENABLE to 0. This is not required for dynamic programming options since e.g. PH0 is not active when these registers are programmed.
3) In any use case where C1CA/C1CB/C1CC are required to be set CLOSED via autonomous scanning, rule (2) cannot be observed. Example use case below**. In this scenario to get the desired effect, the options are to either:
a) Dedicate a specific CSW sensor for this purpose, follow rule (2) and do not change the settings autonomously for this sensor.
b) Use unused Cmod switches (e.g. if Cmod1/2 are being used, use the switches for Cmod3/4).

** Any use case where a csdbusa/b/c is not used. For example FW CSX wherein csdbusc not used; then csdbusc is statically connected to vssa_sc (C1CG=CLOSED, ENABLED=1 and C1CC=CLOSED).</description>

              <description>CMOD2 enable.

Firmware Rule:
1) If any of C2CA/C2CB/C2CC can be 1 (statically or dynamically), ENABLED must be 1.
2) If statically closing (using CLOSED setting) any of C2CA/C2CB/C2CC, ENABLE must be set to 1 in a previous bus access to ensure break-before-make. When re-opening from static CLOSED, C2CA/C2CB/C2CC must be opened in a previous bus access before clearing ENABLE to 0. This is not required for dynamic programming options since e.g. PH0 is not active when these registers are programmed.
3) In any use case where C2CA/C2CB/C2CC are required to be set CLOSED via autonomous scanning, rule (2) cannot be observed. Example use case below**. In this scenario to get the desired effect, the options are to either:
a) Dedicate a specific CSW sensor for this purpose, follow rule (2) and do not change the settings autonomously for this sensor.
b) Use unused Cmod switches (e.g. if Cmod1/2 are being used, use the switches for Cmod3/4).

** Any use case where a csdbusa/b/c is not used. For example FW CSX wherein csdbusc not used; then csdbusc is statically connected to vssa_sc (C2CG=CLOSED, ENABLED=1 and C2CC=CLOSED).</description>

              <description>CMOD3 enable.

Firmware Rule:
1) If any of C3CA/C3CB/C3CC can be 1 (statically or dynamically), ENABLED must be 1.
2) If statically closing (using CLOSED setting) any of C3CA/C3CB/C3CC, ENABLE must be set to 1 in a previous bus access to ensure break-before-make. When re-opening from static CLOSED, C3CA/C3CB/C3CC must be opened in a previous bus access before clearing ENABLE to 0. This is not required for dynamic programming options since e.g. PH0 is not active when these registers are programmed.
3) In any use case where C3CA/C3CB/C3CC are required to be set CLOSED via autonomous scanning, rule (2) cannot be observed. Example use case below**. In this scenario to get the desired effect, the options are to either:
a) Dedicate a specific CSW sensor for this purpose, follow rule (2) and do not change the settings autonomously for this sensor.
b) Use unused Cmod switches (e.g. if Cmod1/2 are being used, use the switches for Cmod3/4).

** Any use case where a csdbusa/b/c is not used. For example FW CSX wherein csdbusc not used; then csdbusc is statically connected to vssa_sc (C3CG=CLOSED, ENABLED=1 and C3CC=CLOSED).</description>

              <description>CMOD4 enable.

Firmware Rule:
1) If any of C4CA/C4CB/C4CC can be 1 (statically or dynamically), ENABLED must be 1.
2) If statically closing (using CLOSED setting) any of C4CA/C4CB/C4CC, ENABLE must be set to 1 in a previous bus access to ensure break-before-make. When re-opening from static CLOSED, C4CA/C4CB/C4CC must be opened in a previous bus access before clearing ENABLE to 0. This is not required for dynamic programming options since e.g. PH0 is not active when these registers are programmed.
3) In any use case where C4CA/C4CB/C4CC are required to be set CLOSED via autonomous scanning, rule (2) cannot be observed. Example use case below**. In this scenario to get the desired effect, the options are to either:
a) Dedicate a specific CSW sensor for this purpose, follow rule (2) and do not change the settings autonomously for this sensor.
b) Use unused Cmod switches (e.g. if Cmod1/2 are being used, use the switches for Cmod3/4).

** Any use case where a csdbusa/b/c is not used. For example FW CSX wherein csdbusc not used; then csdbusc is statically connected to vssa_sc (C4CG=CLOSED, ENABLED=1 and C4CC=CLOSED).</description>

              <name>RAW_COUNT_POS</name>
              <description>Useful for determining component counts for positive and negative charge by subtracting from RAW_COUNT.

When PHASE_MODE_SEL = FOUR_PHASE
  RAW_COUNT_POS: Counts during ph1/ph2 of SUB_CONV.
When PHASE_MODE_SEL = TWO_PHASE
  RAW_COUNT_POS: Counts during ph0 of SUB_CONV.

This counter increments whenever the Cref CAPDAC is balancing during the corresponding phases above. Note that digital non-overlap is ignored for the purposes of this count since balancing occurs irrespective of these settings. Hence the 'raw' phases (pre application of any digital non-overlap) are considered as the measurement window for this counter.

Applicable for CIC1 and CIC2 mode. In CIC2 mode the count is determined by the value of the input to the first integrator stage (equivalent to CIC1 behaviour).</description>

The RESULT_FIFO_RD.RAW_COUNT value is only the true average if the number of valid CIC2 sub-samples is [1,2,4,8,16]. However, in the cases of [3.4.5.6.9.10,11,12,13,14,15] firmware can back-calculate the real average from the computed average (RAW_COUNT) and the divisor used to compute that average (1,2,4,8,16 above) as follows assuming the number of valid sub-samples is known:

Real_Average = Computed_Average*(Computed_Divider/NumSubSamples)

If the number of sub-samples exceeds 16, this cannot be reliably computed due to internal hardware overflows.</description>

              <description>Start the MSCv3 sequencer frame process. Note that a rising edge on this bit also creates a 2x cycle clk_msc pulse on the msc_ext_frm_start_out signal. The corresponding msc_ext_frm_start_out_en is controlled by CTL.ENABLED.

Sequencer FSM clears this bit on egress from IDLE. If START_FRAME is set by firmware when FSM is not in IDLE, the hardware must hold the bit set to allow for 'pending' frame behaviour.

Firmware Rule:
Note if FRAME_CMD is used in a multi-channel scenario care must be taken by firmware not to excessively delay FRAME_CMD to each individual channel. If not, a window exists where the first channel that sees FRAME_CMD can reach the WAIT_CONSENSUS state and mistakenly believe all channels are ready for lockstep scanning when the reality is the other channels are still in IDLE and indicating ready because they haven't been initiated yet.</description>

              <description>The ratio (minus 1) of clk_comp::clk_mod.

Notes for tuning:
Fs = Fmod / Kref
Fcomp = Kcomp * Fs

MSCv3 MMIO provides:
Kref = (SENSE_DIV+1)
Fs = Fmod/(SENSE_DIV+1)
Fcomp = Fmod / (COMP_DIV+1)

Therefore:
Kcomp = Fmod/[Fs*(COMP_DIV+1)]

Kcomp = (SENSE_DIV+1)/(COMP_DIV+1)

It is expected that Kcomp be programmed as an integer. Anything else is considered a mis-programming.</description>

              <description>Sense mode register structure selection. This field allows quick change between registers that influence sense mode. This register selects which structure is currently 'live' and used by the IP.

These registers are captured in MODE_STRUCT. The usable values in this register is determined by design time parameter SENSE_MODE_NR.</description>

              <name>DECIM_RATE</name>
              <description>Sets the decimation rate for the sinc^2 filter (CIC2). Typically referred to as N. Note N = DECIM_RATE + 1. Only applies when FILTER_CTL.FILTER_MODE = CIC2, and irrelevant for CIC1 mode (no effect in this mode).

Maximum value out of CIC2 is N^2 (unsigned input) and +/- N^2 (signed input).

Since CIC2 uses a 16-bit pipeline, the maximum range is [0,2^16-1] (unsigned) and [-2^15,2^15-1] (signed). This implies a limitation on maximum usable DECIM_RATE depending on BIT_FORMAT signed/unsigned.

BIT_FORMAT = UNSIGNED -&gt; DECIM_RATE(max) = 254 (N = 255).
BIT_FORMAT = SIGNED -&gt; DECIM_RATE(max) = 180 (N = 181).

The scan time for M-bit scan is 2^M clk_mod cycles. This value is determined by (SENSE_DIV+1)*(NUM_SUB_CONVS+1).

Note that the CIC2 filter does not operate in the EPILOGUE state, so NUM_EPI_CYCLES does not feed into the above equation.</description>

              <name>SENSE_DIV</name>
              <description>The length (minus 1) of the sense modulation 'clock' period in clk_mod cycles (frequency = Fs). SENSE_DIV + 1 = sense_ratio.
Note this is the base divider, clock dithering may change the actual period length.

Firmware Rule: Firmware is responsible for programming a value in this register to ensure correct operation. When LFSR_MODE = DIRECT_CLOCK, in 2-phase mode sense_ratio needs to be &gt;=4 to allow for digital non-overlap. In 4-phase mode, sense_ratio needs to be &gt;=8. 

If spread spectrum is enabled (LFSR_MODE = SPREAD_SPECTRUM), SENSE_DIV must be programmed large enough to ensure that negative dithering does not cause sense_ratio to become too small.

It is possible for SENSE_DIV to be as low as zero though when LFSR_MODE = PRS (if digital non-overlap is disabled). This is because in PRS mode, SENSE_DIV defines the rate at which the LFSR is clocked and the MSB of the LFSR is used to create the phase signals.</description>

              <description>Control MUX Sensor N enable.

Firmware Rule:
1) If any of SNCA/SNCB/SNCC can be 1 (statically or dynamically), ENABLED must be 1.
2) If statically closing (using CLOSED setting) any of SNCA/SNCB/SNCC, ENABLE must be set to 1 in a previous bus access to ensure break-before-make. When re-opening from static CLOSED, SNCA/SNCB/SNCC must be opened in a previous bus access before clearing ENABLE to 0. This is not required for dynamic programming options since e.g. PH0 is not active when these registers are programmed.
3) In any use case where SNCA/SNCB/SNCC are required to be set CLOSED via autonomous scanning, rule (2) cannot be observed. Example use case below**. In this scenario to get the desired effect, the options are to either:
a) Dedicate a specific CSW sensor for this purpose, follow rule (2) and do not change the settings autonomously for this sensor.
b) Use unused Cmod switches (e.g. if Cmod1/2 are being used, use the switches for Cmod3/4).

** Any use case where a csdbusa/b/c is not used. For example FW CSX wherein csdbusc not used; then csdbusc is statically connected to vssa_sc (SNCG=CLOSED, ENABLED=1 and SNCC=CLOSED).</description>

Notes: 
1) Equations below describe 'msb' term as raw LFSR output, and take into account overriding as defined by ACTIVATION_MODE.
2) Glitches on FLBV or FLBG during ph0 or ph2 are acceptable (if msb toggles at this time) as the FLTCA and FLCB switches are open during this phase so there is no connection into the comparator or the Cmod caps.</description>

                <description>Activation event for Dither/Flatspot LFSR.
'0': Clock LFSR on ph0.
'1': Clock LFSR on ph0 or ph2.

Notes:
PH0 activation can be used in both 2 and 4 phase mode (PHASE_MODE_SEL).
PH0_OR_PH2 activation can be used in 4 phase mode only (PHASE_MODE_SEL).

In PH0 activation mode, the LFSR clocks on ph0 only. However hardware autonomously intervenes by processing the LFSR MSB before routing to the HardIP as follows during any given sense period:

PHASE_MODE_SEL = TWO_PHASE:
Invert LFSR MSB on ph1 rising edge.

PHASE_MODE_SEL = FOUR_PHASE:
Invert LFSR MSB on ph2 rising edge.</description>

'0': 1 bit period.

In UART mode, this field specifies the data field size:
'0': 5 bit data field.

'2': 7 bit data field.
'3': 8 bit data field.
When the data field size is less than 8 bits, the most significant (unused) bits of the DATAx.DATAy[7:0] fields should be set to '0' for the transmitter.</description>

                <name>BREAK_WAKEUP_LENGTH</name>
                <description>Break/wakeup length (minus 1) in bit periods:
'0': 1 bit period.
...
'10': 11 bit periods (break length for slave nodes)
...
'12': 13 bit periods (break length for master nodes)
...
'30': 31 bit periods.
'31': Illegal (should NOT be used!!!)

This field is used for transmission/reception of BOTH break and wakeup signals. Note that these functions are mutually exclusive:
- When CMD.TX_HEADER is '1', the field specifies the transmitted break field.
- When CMD.TX_WAKEUP is '1', the field specifies the transmitted wakeup field.
- When CMD.RX_HEADER is '1', the field specifies the to be received break field.
- Otherwise, the field specifies the to be received wakeup field.

Per the standard, the master wakeup duration is between 250 us and 5 ms. To support uncalibrated slaves, a slave has a detection threshold of 150 us (3 bit periods at 20 kbps). After transmission of a break or wakeup signal, the INTR.TX_BREAK_WAKEUP_DONE interrupt cause is activated. After reception of a wakeup signal, the INTR.RX_BREAK_WAKEUP_DONE interrupt cause is activated.

To specify longer wakeup signals in terms of absolute time (us/ms rather than bit periods), the associated PERI clock divider value can be (temporarily) increased to make the LIN bit period longer.

Note: entering bus sleep mode is achieved with the 'go-to-sleep' command.</description>

- RX_HEADER, TX_RESPONSE.

The header is transmitted when the PID field STOP bits are transmitted (INTR.TX_HEADER_DONE).

HW sets this field to '1', when the 'tr_cmd_tx_header' input trigger is activated. This allows for time triggered LIN message transfer. HW driven time triggered transfer eliminates the jitter that is typically associated with SW driven transfer.

In UART mode, a single data field (DATA0.DATA1) is transmitted.</description>

The header is received when the PID field STOP bits are received (INTR.RX_HEADER_DONE).

Typically, a slave node SW sets both RX_HEADER and RX_RESPONSE to '1', anticipating a transfer of a response from the master node to this slave node. After receipt of the header PID field (INTR.RX_HEADER_PID_DONE is activated), the slave node may decide to set TX_RESPONSE to '1' (which has a higher priority than RX_RESPONSE) to transmit a response.

the Break detection is performed regardless of CMD.RX_HEADER.
INTR.RX_BREAK_WAKEUP_DONE will trigger at LIN_RX rising edge, when the low pulse meet CTL0.BREAK_WAKEUP_LENGTH. when Break is detected, HW check CMD.RX_HEADER before entering SYNC byte processing state. when RX_HEADER is cleared, SW has at least 11 bit times to set RX_HEADER again, before next Break is detected (RX_BREAK_WAKEUP_DONE). in this case, there is no gap, Break will never be missed.

                <description>Synchronization counter in LIN channel clock periods. After the receipt of a synchronization field, this fields reflects the duration of the synchronization field. Ideally, SYNC_COUNTER = 8*16 = 128 (the synchronization fields consists of eight bit period of 16 LIN channel clock periods each).
- If SYNC_COUNTER is less than 128, the LIN channel clock is too slow and the PERI/PCLK divider value should be decreased.
- If SYNC_COUNTER is greater than 128, the LIN channel clock is too fast and the PERI/PCLK divider value should be increased.

The biggest master-slave clock discrepancy occurs when the master is slow and the slave is fast or vice versa. At a 0.5 percent master inaccuracy and a 14 percent slave inaccuracy, this results in the extreme synchronization values of (.86 * 128) / 1.005 = 109.5 and (1.14 *128) / 0.995 = 146.6. We add a little margin for a valid range of [106, 152].

Note: Only slave nodes with imprecise clocks require clock resynchronization. Master and slave nodes with precise clocks do NOT require clock resynchronization.</description>

- After a legal command sequence, HW clears this field to '0'. The end of the command sequence is effectively postponed by a 4-bit period postamble.

Note: external transceivers require a 'power up' or 'power down' period of 1 or 2 bit periods, so a 4-bit period suffices for all known transceivers.</description>

                <description>Header protected identifier (PID). 
- Bits 5 down to 0: frame identifier ID[5:0].
Frame identifier 0x3c is for a 'master request' frame, 0x3d is for a 'slave response' frame, 0x3e and 0x3f are for future LIN enhancements. Frame identifier ID[5:4] is optionally used for length control; i.e. specifies the number of response data fields.
- Bits 1 down to 0: parity bits P[1] and P[0].
  - P[1] = ! (ID[5] ^ ID[4] ^ ID[3] ^ ID[1])
  - P[0] = (ID[4] ^ ID[2] ^ ID[1] ^ ID[0])

Transmission: To be transmitted PID field. SW needs to calculate the PID field parity bits P[1] and P[0].

Reception: Received PID field. Slave node SW uses the PID field to determine how to handle the response for a received frame header: TX_RESPONSE or  RX_RESPONSE.</description>

Transmission: HW calculated checksum (SW does not need to calculate the checksum) over the transmitted PID field (optional per CTL.CHECKSUM_ENHANCED) and data fields.

Reception: Received checksum. Note that in case of a RX_CHECKSUM_ERROR, SW can use the received PID field and the  received data fields to calculate the correct checksum value.</description>

              <description>Specifies the channel index of the channel to which test applies. The channel IO signals of channel indices CH_IDX and CH_NR-1 are connected as specified by MODE. CH_IDX should be in the range [0, CH_NR-2], as channel index CH_NR-1 is always involved in test and cannot be connected to itself. The test mode allows BOTH of the two connected channels to be tested.

Note: this testing functionality simplifies SW development, but may also be used in the field to verify correct channel functionality.</description>

1 - If received PID[6:0] = 0 and PID[7]=1'b1, HW (slave) does not clear CMD.RX_HEADER and will anticipate receiving header again (CMD.TX_HEADER=0). If CMD.TX_HEADER=1 in the same scenario, then HW (slave) clears CMD.RX_HEADER upon receiving the header follow by transmit PID. This mode is useful for case where polling method is used and CXPI controller is configured as slave. This would reduce dependency on SW to react to the header received within IBS=1.</description>

...
'10': 10 bit periods

Values of &lt;10 are not allowed.
This field is used for transmission/reception for adding waiting inter frame space. 
Note that after a valid transaction (after CRC), HW waits for 10 bits as EOF. Hence, by setting CTL0.IFS=0xA means that HW will wait for 10bits before transmitting a new transaction (not including the EOF).
Note: 0 is not allowed when IFS_WAIT=1. SW needs to ensure it has program valid values before it can set IFS_WAIT=1.
If IFS_WAIT=1 after timeout occurs, the value of CTL0.IFS would need to consider the timeout count i.e. (IFS needed - CTL2.TIMEOUT_LENGTH-1) to get the total idle time. For example if TIMEOUT_LENGTH=9 and IFS needed is 20, then CTL0.IFS is set to 10.</description>

Values &gt;9 are invalid per spec.
This field is used to control number of IBS after every byte frame when transmitting message frame. 
Note that this field is the minimum IBS inserted for every byte frame as the SW may require some time to prepare the response when it receives the PID. 
When receiving, this field is ignored with the exception of receiving header and transmitting response. For receiving header and transmitting response, SW can enable IBS insertion by setting TIMEOUT_SEL=1/2 prior to setting CMD.RX_HEADER=1 and CMD.RX_RESPONSE=1. If the received header corresponds to transmit response, SW clears CMD.RX_RESPONSE =0 and sets TX FIFO and CMD.TX_RESPONSE=1. HW waits for minimum IBS before transmit response (if timeout has not occurred yet). It is prohibit to program IBS&gt;TIMEOUT_LENGTH. 
This field should not be changed during inflight transaction including EOF.</description>

                <description>Timeout Select. 
'0' - Timeout check is disabled. HW clears timeout counter.
'1' - Timeout check is enabled and HW will refer to TIMEOUT_LENGTH as number of Tbits allowed between header and response.
'2' - Timeout check is enabled to check header-header, header-response, and header-header-response within a message frame to be space within TIMEOUT_LENGTH bit time.
'3' - invalid
For '1', HW will restart/start timeout counter after transmitting/receiving header. HW will hold the counter if timeout until the next header is transmitted or received. Timeout will cause HW to stop transmission of the current message frame together with interrupt to SW. For receive, HW abort reception of the frame if timeout occurs while waiting for receiving response and notify SW with interrupt.
For '2', HW will re-start/start timeout counter after receiving any frame bytes within a message frame. HW will hold the counter if timeout until the IFS. Timeout will cause HW to stop transmission of the current message frame and notify SW with interrupt. For receive, HW will abort reception of the message frame if timeout occurs while waiting for receiving response and notify SW with interrupt.
For all cases, HW stops counting when it is out of a message frame such as IFS or CXPI bus IDLE. If the timeout counter &gt; TIMEOUT_LENGTH, then it will set the INTR.TIMEOUT=1. 
Note that, TIMEOUT_SEL=1/2 also enables the count for IBS between receive header and transmit response on top of timeout check.</description>

HW sets this field to '0' on successful completion of ANY of the following legal command sequences (also set to '0' when an error (such as bit error if bit_ignore=0, arbitration loss, tx data length error. For timeout please refer to SAS) is detected):
- TX_HEADER
- TX_HEADER, TX_RESPONSE.
- TX_HEADER, RX_RESPONSE.
The above is for transmission of PID without prior transmission of PTYPE.
The header is transmitted when the PID field STOP bits are transmitted (INTR.TX_HEADER_DONE).

HW sets this field to '1', when the 'tr_cmd_tx_header' input trigger is activated. This allows for time triggered CXPI message transfer. HW driven time triggered transfer eliminates the jitter that is typically associated with SW driven transfer.
SW clears this field to '0', when it wants to cancel a pending request. Note that if SW clears this field to '0' while HW is already in the middle of the request, then the cancel will be ignored. The cancel request can happen when HW is pending a retry when it is still servicing the current transaction. Or the cancel request can occur when HW is checking IFS/bus idle-ness.
Note that if PTYPE (TX_HEADER) is transmitted follow by receive response (RX_RESPONSE) or no response, HW clears TX_HEADER right after transmitting PTYPE.</description>

If SW programs SLEEP=1 during HW executing TX_WAKEUP_PULSE command, it will cause HW to abruptly stop transmitting wakeup pulse as below:
1. HW not clearing TX_WAKEUP_PULSE

For the case of CXPI master mode, HW will move its power mode from Sleep-&gt;Standby when this field is set to '1'. When SW clears this field is from '1' to '0' in Standby mode, HW will move to Normal mode while HW starts transmitting clock. To transmit wake pulse, SW need to program TX_WAKE_PULSE accordingly in Standby mode before entering Normal.
For the case of CXPI slave mode and PWM mode, HW will move power mode from Sleep-&gt;Standby when this field is set to '1'. HW will wait for detection of clock before moving from Standby-&gt;Normal. SW clearing this field to '0' will have no effect.
For the case of CXPI slave mode and NRZ mode, HW will move power mode from Sleep-&gt;Standby when this field is set to '1'. HW needs to be directed by SW by clearing this field to '0' to move from Standby-&gt;Normal after SW has detected clock through another IP (e.g. MXTCPWM).</description>

HW will keep this field to '1' if it detects logical '0' before fulfilling the number of logical '1' required. 

The intention of this bit is to provide capability for SW to direct HW to check bus idle-ness before transmitting. Without setting this bit before directing HW to send header, HW will not check bus idle before transmitting. Besides that, this bit will also provide SW an option to configure HW to wait for IFS before sending again PTYPE or PID to fulfill IFS if there is no response from other nodes. 
Note: SW needs to configure valid IFS values before setting IFS_WAIT=1.</description>

-RX_HEADER
-RX_HEADER, TX_RESPONSE
-RX_HEADER, RX_RESPONSE
The above applies for cases of receiving PID without prior receiving PTYPE.
The header is received when the PID field STOP bits are received (INTR.RX_HEADER_PID_DONE and INTR.RX_HEADER_DONE). 

Typically, a slave node SW sets both RX_HEADER and RX_RESPONSE to '1', anticipating a transfer of a response from the master node to this slave node. After receipt of the header PID/PTYPE field (INTR.RX_HEADER_PID_DONE is activated), the slave node may decide to set TX_RESPONSE to '1' (which has lower priority than RX_RESPONSE hence RX_RESPONSE need to be clear to '0' by SW) to transmit a response.
Note that, for cases with RXPIDZERO_CHECK_EN=1 for slave in polling mode, RX_HEADER is cleared upon receiving PTYPE if the next course of action is to transmit PID. If the next course of action is to receive PID, then the RX_HEADER is cleared upon completion of response.</description>

SW can set this field to '1' to be conservative on receiving response i.e. IBS=0 whenever it is receiving PID. If the PID corresponds to transmit response, the SW can then clear this field to '0' and set TX_RESPONSE=1 to direct HW to send response. 

The response is received after CRC are received (INTR.RX_RESPONSE_DONE).</description>

Software does not need to program the parity bit i.e. bit[7]. HW will calculate the odd parity bit and ignore the bit[7] if SW occupies this bit. 

Transmission: To be transmitted PID field. HW will ignore bit[7] and compute the parity bit based on bits[6:0]

Note that, this field can be use by SW to send PType byte as the HW handles both PID and PType the same way. The frame type would occupy bit[6:0] and the odd parity will be calculated by the HW.</description>

If shifting is not enabled (AVG_SHIFT=0) then the result is forced to shift right so that is fits in 16 bits, so right shift is done by max(0,AVG_CNT-3).
- In INTERLEAVED mode one sample is taken per triggered scan, only in the scan where the final averaging count is reached a valid average is calculated and stored in the RESULT register (by definition the same scan for all the channels that have averaging enabled). In all other scans the RESULT register for averaged channels will have an invalid result and the intermediate accumulated value is stored in the 16-bit WORK register. In this mode make sure that the averaging count is low enough to ensure that the intermediate value does not exceed 16-bits otherwise the MSBs will be lost. So for a 12-bit resolution the averaging count should be set to 16 or less (AVG_CNT=&lt;3).</description>

NOTE: If all channels in a scan are configured for interleaved averaging, then EOS is only asserted after the last scan of the average count.  In addition, a new trigger which would cause a collision, will be ignored, except for the last scan of the average count. If the collision is detected in the the last scan, the trigger will be pended and will be executed after the last scan is completed.</description>

              <description>Legacy differential mode, usage is described by port below:
SARMUX: Legacy mode, use applications should use NEG_PORT/PIN_ADDR

EXPMUX: Legacy mode, use applications should use NEG_PORT/PIN_ADDR
DIAGMUX: Not applicable
SARMUX_VIRT: Special purpose, see SARMUX_VIRT description

LEGACY MODE DESCRIPTION:
Differential enable for the selected port pin for this channel.  If differential is enabled then POS_PIN_ADDR[0] is ignored and considered to be 0, i.e. POS_PIN_ADDR points to the even pin of a pin pair. For differential the even pin of the pair is connected to Vplus and the odd pin of the pair is connected to Vminus. POS_PORT_ADDR is used to identify the port that contains the pins.
- 0: The voltage on the addressed pin is measured (Single-ended) and the resulting value is stored in the corresponding data register.
- 1: The differential voltage on the addressed pin pair is measured and the resulting value is stored in the corresponding data register. (POS_PIN_ADDR[0] is ignored).

NOTE: Set to 0 if using the NEG_PIN_ADDR and NEG_PORT_ADDR to select the negative source.</description>

LEGACY MODE DESCRIPTION:
Differential enable for the selected port pin for this channel.  If differential is enabled then POS_PIN_ADDR[0] is ignored and considered to be 0, i.e. POS_PIN_ADDR points to the even pin of a pin pair. For differential the even pin of the pair is connected to Vplus and the odd pin of the pair is connected to Vminus. POS_PORT_ADDR is used to identify the port that contains the pins.
- 0: The voltage on the addressed pin is measured (Single-ended) and the resulting value is stored in the corresponding data register.
- 1: The differential voltage on the addressed pin pair is measured and the resulting value is stored in the corresponding data register. (POS_PIN_ADDR[0] is ignored).

NOTE: Set to 0 if using the NEG_PIN_ADDR and NEG_PORT_ADDR to select the negative source.</description>

Cleared by hardware after this channel has been sampled (i.e. this channel is always one shot even if CONTINUOUS is set). Also cleared if the SAR is disabled.

NOTE: If the intent is to trigger an injection channel with no tailgaiting (immediately if not busy), just prior to a firmware trigger, the following sequence must be followed to ensure that the injection channel starts first:
- Trigger injection channel (set this bit to 1)
- Poll for busy (wait for STATUS.SAR_BUSY == 1)
- Trigger the scan (START_CTRL.FW_TRIGGER set to 1)</description>

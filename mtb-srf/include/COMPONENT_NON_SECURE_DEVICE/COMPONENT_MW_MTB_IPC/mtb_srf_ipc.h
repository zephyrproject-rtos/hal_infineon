/**
 * \addtogroup group_mtb_srf_ipc Secure Request IPC integration
 * \{
 *
 * This library provides support for sending requests from an alternative core to the core with the
 * secure paritition. The non-secure partition acts as a relay to unpack the request sent over
 * Infineon's interprocessor communication library (MTB-IPC) and submit it in the same way as other
 * non-secure requests. The library also provides functionality to signal completion so the
 * requesting core can view the results. This is accomplished through two roles: Client and Relay.
 * The Client owns a pool of requests that are tied to IPC semaphores that will signal completion.
 * The relay receives unpacks requests on the core containing the secure region before processing
 * and signalling. This requires each of the contexts to be set up to create the relay relationship
 * and begin submitting requests. Refer to SRF documentation \ref group_mtb_srf for more information
 * on secure requests and request pools. The APIs for submiting a request remain the same on all
 * cores, but a client context must be set up on the core that needs IPC in order for the request to
 * be sent correctly.
 *
 * Refer to \ref group_mtb_srf_ipc_code_snippets for more information.
 *
 ********************************************************************************
 * \section group_mtb_srf_ipc_prerequisites  Prerequisites
 ********************************************************************************
 * The IPC components of the SRF IPC integration must be set up prior to transfer. Please refer to
 * MTB-IPC documentation on how to setup an IPC instance and a mailbox for request transfer. The MTB
 * SRF IPC will by default consume MTB_SRF_IPC_SEMA_COUNT + 3 semaphores for its own use.
 *
 * \section section_impl_srf_ipc_request_data_ Request pool data memory allocation
 * Request pool data memory allocation can be done with help of MTB_SRF_IPC_REQUEST_DATA_ALLOC
 * macro, but using it is not mandatory, so user can allocate memory for the shared memory in any
 * convenient for them way. This struct is necessary to store and keep track of all shared objects
 * during operation.
 ********************************************************************************
 * \section group_mtb_srf_ipc_custom_packet  Custom Packet
 ********************************************************************************
 * Many APIs can be overridden with macros to allow custom implementations. To support this, the
 * mtb_srf_ipc_packet_t type can be overriden via the define MTB_SRF_IPC_CUSTOM_PACKET_TYPE.
 * However, the various APIs have minimum requirements on what this type defines.
 *
 * mtb_srf_ipc_request_submit, overridden via MTB_SRF_CUSTOM_IPC_REQUEST_SUBMIT, requires all the
 * default packet struct members to operate.
 *
 * mtb_srf_ipc_process_request, overridden via MTB_SRF_CUSTOM_PROCESS_REQUEST, requires the ioVec
 * pointers and counts (inVec_ptr, inVec_cnt_ns, outVec_ptr, outVec_cnt_ns).
 *
 * mtb_srf_ipc_signal_complete, which cannot be overriden, requires the semaphore_idx member.
 *
 * All other APIs interact with the packet type as a pointer and aren't affected by the contents.

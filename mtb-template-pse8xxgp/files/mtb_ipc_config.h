/**
 * \addtogroup group_mtb_ipc_config MTB IPC Configuration
 * \{
 * The ModusToolbox Interprocessor communication library (MTB-IPC) requires reservation of IPC
 * channels and interrupts.
 * Please refer to device documentation for what channels and interrupts are avaliable on the
 * device.
 * Reservation ensures that there is no overlap between libraries that use IPC.
 * By default, the only library that has a reservation is MTB-SRF and these values
 * must not be deleted for SRF to function correctly.
 *
 * This file is owned by the application.  The expectation is for the user to store channel and
 * interrupt reservations
 * as needed.  Should the user wish to use a middleware library that depends on MTB IPC,
 * the user can keep track of which channels and interrupts have been used here.

# Serial Memory Library Release Notes
Provides functions for interacting with an external memory connected through its Single/Dual/Quad/Octal SPI interface.

### What's Included?
* APIs for Read/Write/Erase operations
* Supports Execute-in-Place (XIP) mode of operation
* Accepts the configuration generated by the QSPI Configurator tool
* Allows for providing information to the programming tool to program the external memory.

### What Changed?
#### v3.0.0
* Support SMIF MemNum interface instead of MemSlot interface
#### v2.0.0
* Renamed library from serial-flash to serial-memory. All APIs were renamed from cy_serial_flash_* to mtb_serial_memory_* and all macros were prefaced with MTB_SERIAL_MEMORY_* .
#### v1.4.3
* Added functions for attach/detach to pre-existing peripheral configurations
#### v1.4.2
* Added support for CAT1C devices.
* Switched driver from PDL functions call to corresponding HAL calls, where it is possible.
#### v1.3.0
* Added support for CAT1B device - CYW20829.
#### v1.2.0
* Added support for HAL API v1 or v2
#### v1.1.0
* Added the following functions:
    - `cy_serial_flash_qspi_read_async()` - Supports asynchronous (non-blocking) read using fixed DMA resources. Refer to the API reference manual for details on the list of devices supported for DMA operation and the exact DMA resources used.
    - `cy_serial_flash_qspi_abort_read()` - Aborts an ongoing asynchronous read operation
    - `cy_serial_flash_qspi_set_dma_interrupt_priority()` - Changes the DMA interrupt priority
* Implemented thread-safety for use with multi-threaded RTOS environment using the [abstraction-rtos](https://github.com/infineon/abstraction-rtos) library
    - Add `DEFINES=CY_SERIAL_FLASH_QSPI_THREAD_SAFE` in the Makefile to enable thread-safety
* Updated `cy_serial_flash_qspi_get_erase_size()` to support memories with hybrid sectors
#### v1.0.2
* Added new function `cy_serial_flash_qspi_get_prog_size()` to get the programming size
* Minor documentation updates
#### v1.0.1
* Minor update for documentation & branding
#### v1.0.0
* Initial release
